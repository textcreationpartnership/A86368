            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>God, as appears in the former chapters, had many wayes made tryall of <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience. <hi>Get thee,</hi> ſaith God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 12. chapter, 1. verſe, <hi>Get thee out of thy Country and from thy kindred, and from thy Fathers Houſe unto the land that I will ſhew thee.</hi> This was a hard Commandement. <hi>Abraham</hi> was then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fourſcore years old, and he muſt begin to travell and which might grieve him the more, he muſt travell into a farre Country; but he knowes not whither;<note place="margin">

But it may be when he came thither, this was a place to ſeate himſelf in, and better it may be then in his own Country. He was no ſooner come thither,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.10.</note> but he was welcom'd into the Land with an extreame famine, inſomuch that he was fain to ſhift for himſelf, and to fly into <hi>Egypt</hi> and his wife with him; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was contented, and never murmured againſt God. But it may be when he came thither his entertainment was better. He was no ſooner come thither,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.15.</note> but <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife was taken from him, and for no other cauſe; but becauſe ſhe was ſo beautifull to look upon. Still <hi>Abraham</hi> perſiſted without any murmuring. But it may be that God had extraordinarily bleſſed him in all other
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118276:6"/>matters. It is true indeed, that God had greatly bleſt him; but yet ſo, as that, that which of all wordly things he chiefly deſired, he ſtill wanted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2.</note> the comfort of having a Sonne to ſucceed him. And therefore in the 15. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe,</hi> when God had promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his exceeding reward, <hi>Abraham</hi> takes the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and preſently puts up a Petition to God, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>What wilt thou give me ſeeing I go childleſſe, and the Steward of my houſe is this</hi> Eliezer <hi>of</hi> Damaſcus; <hi>Behold, thou haſt given no ſeed unto me, and therefore my ſervant muſt be my heir.</hi> This was that which ſo troubled <hi>Abraham:</hi> God had given him great wealth and riches, but what ſhould he do with them, he himſelf was old and might well ſuppoſe, that he could not long enjoy them, he was in a Country where he had no Kindred, and he muſt leave them to a ſtranger that muſt ſucceed him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.15.</note> God promiſed him iſſue; and firſt he gave him <hi>Jſhmael</hi> by <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman: but this was not he that ſhould be his Heir, but another which <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife ſhould bear him. To be ſhort, <hi>Sarah</hi> conceived and brought forth <hi>Iſaac;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>17.19.</hi> Iſaac.</note> God himſelf had given him his name before he was borne, a name which ſignified joy and laughter; becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be a comfort and joy to his Father. And now old <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſoule is revived; when he ſeeth his Sonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> preſently he thinks he hath lived long enough now he hath a Sonne to ſucceed him; but preſently again he checks his thoughts, and wiſhes to live longer, that he may the longer injoy him. But <hi>Abrahams</hi> joy may not long continue, God hath another croſſe for him in ſtore, and that is this; <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt take <hi>Jſhmael</hi> his firſt begotten, and caſt him out of dores with his mother <hi>Hagar.</hi> But this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was a grief to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet it inflamed his affection the more towards <hi>Iſaac.</hi> For, as when <hi>Eliah</hi> was taken away, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was doubled upon <hi>Eliſha:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.9, 10.</note> ſo <hi>Jſhmael</hi> being gone, now <hi>Iſaac</hi> is his Fathers only darling; and now <hi>Abrahams</hi> affection is doubled upon him. But when God ſees this his deep-ſetled love, he ſtrikes him as it were with a thunder bolt from Heaven, and commands him to kill this his onely Son. A Commandement more cruell then the Lawes of <hi>Draco</hi> which were written in blood; wherein every word ſtabs <hi>Abraham</hi> to the heart. <hi>Take</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy Son, thine onely Son even</hi> Iſaac <hi>thine onely beloved Son.</hi> Was it not enough, O Lord, ſaith <hi>Origen,</hi> that thou doſt command him to kill his Sonne; but

            <p>We read in the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Hiſtories,<note place="margin">Sozomen. lib. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>24.</hi>
               </note> That a certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in <hi>Theodoſious</hi> time, hearing that two of his Sonnes were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners, at the day appointed that they ſhould be executed, he came in all haſte to <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> where his Sonnes were, &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter why his Sonnes were to ſuffer, he firſt offered a great ſumme of money for his Sonnes Ranſome, and when that would not be taken, he offered his own life, and made ſute that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might die in their roome. They who had the charge of the Priſoners committed unto them, made him this anſwer, that his death could not poſſibly excuſe them both, becauſe a ſet number were appointed to ſuffer; but offered withall, that if he would die for any one of them, his death ſhould be taken. The Father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accepted their offer, and mourning and lamenting over both his Sonnes, he would willingly have died for either of them, but he knew not whether: ſo great was this Fathers affection unto his Sonnes, that though it were equally divided between them both, yet he was willing to have ſaved either of their lives, even
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118276:7"/>with the loſſe of his own.<note place="margin">His onely Sonne.</note> But now if a Father have but one Sonne, then all his care, all his love, all his affection is wholly ſet upon him, and then it is the greateſt grief in the world to loſe him. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the ſixt of his Propheſie ſpeaking of the great mourning which the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould make, when their moſt cruel enemies the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould come to deſtroy them,<note place="margin">

And therefore our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 3. to ſet forth Gods infinite love towards us;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 3.16.</note> he ſaith, That God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son. If a Father have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sonnes,<note place="margin">Pluta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amicorum.</note> his affection is divided among them all, and therefore the leſſe towards any one; like a River, which being cut into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Channels, his current ye know muſt needes be the weaker. If a Father have many Sons, the loſſe of one cannot be ſo grievous unto him, becauſe he finds comfort in thoſe which are left him; but having but one, if he looſe him (eſpecially when he is old as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was) this muſt needes be an extraordiraly grief unto him. And yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe is far more grievous.<note place="margin">His beloved Sonne.</note> Many a Father, though he have but one Son, yet his grief is the leſſe, when he is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; becauſe while he lived he was a grief unto him. But <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> muſt looſe not his Son onely, and his onely Son, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> his onely joy and comfort, <hi>Iſaac</hi> his onely beloved Son. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was never any Father, that had the like cauſe to love his Sonne. Parents do commonly love their Children, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are their own fleſh and blood, or becauſe they continue their name after them; for ſo long as their Children and Poſterity continue, they ſeeme in a manner to live in them. But beſides theſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had many other cauſes, and far more forcible to love his Sonne. <hi>Abraham</hi> as we heard before (out of the 15 of <hi>Gen.</hi>) even longed as it were to have a Sonne; after that God had promiſed him a Sonne, many a year paſt before he had him. In the mean time, God to make him as it were amends for his long expectation, had given him many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſes concerning this Sonne; as that his ſeed ſhould be called in <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19.</note> that he would multiply his ſeed like the ſtarres of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118276:7"/>Heaven; that he would eſtabliſh his Covenant with <hi>Iſaac</hi> for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant, and with his ſeed after him. And hath not <hi>Abraham</hi> then an extraordinary cauſe to love his Sonne? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully a hundred years old before he had him, <hi>Sarah</hi> had been barren for a long time, and if ſhe had not been ſo, yet by reaſon of her age ſhe was paſt bearing; ſo that God had wrought a double miracle, in giving him a Sonne; all which did more inflame his affection towards him; and yet now all upon the ſuddain, as if God had repented him of his former kindneſs, he commands him to ſacrifice this his onely Sonne; what now might <hi>Abraham</hi> think with himſelf? he might now ſuppoſe that God had but deluded him in all his promiſes, and that God had given him many faire words concerning his Sonne;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job.</hi> 10.1.2.</note> but all to no purpoſe. And ſurely had it not bin <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered like <hi>Job,</hi> in the bitterneſs of his ſoule, to have pleaded with God; he would have ſtood up in the behalf of his Sonne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed again: And is this that <hi>Iſaac</hi> that ſhould be my comfort? is this he whom thou haſt ſo often promiſed, and whom I have ſo long expected, as a pledge of thy love and favour towards me? and muſt I now kill him? <hi>Quid meus hic Iſaac in te committere,</hi> &amp;c. Alas, what hath <hi>Iſaac</hi> committed againſt thee? how hath he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee? who will ever believe that thou wouldeſt have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Sodom,</hi> had there been ten that were good in it, if thou now takeſt delight in the blood of the innocent? doeſt thou thus reward thy Children and Servants? and is this the fruit of their love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? O let it not be known in <hi>Gath</hi> nor publiſhed in <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> leſt the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtins</hi> inſult over thy people, &amp; ſay among themſelves; ſuch honour may have all his Saints. But <hi>Abraham</hi> never opened his mouth for his Sonne, but grace having got the upper hand of nature, and faith of affection, he was glad when God had given him a Sonne; but more glad that he had a Sonne to give unto God: for ſo ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom, Latus erat Abraham cum ſilium acciperet, laetior cum ſibi imolandum dominus poſtularet: Abraham</hi> rejoyced when he received his Sonne, but he rejoyced more, when God commanded him to offer him unto him.<label type="milestone">

            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> that may be gathered from hence is this: That God makes tryall of our love and obedience, in thoſe things which of all other are deareſt unto us. For ſo we ſee he deales here with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when he ſees how dearly he loves his Sonne; for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118276:8"/>tryall of his love and obedience, he commands him to offer him for a burnt-offring.</p>
            <p>Thus dealt our Saviour with the Ruler in the Goſpell;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.22.</note> for knowing that he was rich, and withall, that his heart was ſet upon his treaſure, he willed him to ſell all that ever he had, and to give it to the poor, and ſo tryed him in that which was deareſt unto him.</p>
            <p>He,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 10.37.</note> ſaith our Saviour, that loveth Father, Mother, Sonne or Daughter more then me, he is not worthy of me. It is no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary love which God requires of us, but ſuch a love as is able to ſubdue all naturall affection: So that if our Children were dearer unto us then our own ſoules; yet the love of God is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them.</p>
            <p>And this was prefigured by thoſe milch kine (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.) which being to carry the Arke of the Lord, it is ſaid, that their Calves were taken from them, and yet they went on, and onely ſometimes did low after their Calves, but never turned back to look after them. To note unto us, that Religion muſt alwayes overſway affection, and though we do naturally love our Children, yet if they be any hinderance unto us in Gods ſervice, we are not to regard them. It is the commendation of <hi>Levi</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 33.) that he ſaid to his Father and Mother, he had not ſeen them, and that he knew not his Brethren nor his own Children.

            <p>It is noted by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that among other arguments of <hi>Caligula</hi> his great cruelty,<note place="margin">Sueton. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. <hi>27</hi> Sect.</note> this was one, That Parents were often compelled by him, to be preſent themſelves at the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their children: And when a father would have excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his abſence from his ſons execution, in regard of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: we read there, that <hi>Caligula</hi> ſent him his horſe-litter to bring him thither: but we never read among all his cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he forced any father to be his ſons executioner. There have been ſome, ſaith <hi>Philo,</hi> who for the ſafety and good of their Countrey,<note place="margin">Philo lib. de Abra.</note> have ſuffered their children to be ſacrificed to their gods, but they in the mean time, have either ſtaied at home, and would not be preſent when their children were ſacrificed, or if they were preſent, they have turned away their eyes, and covered their faces, as unable to behold ſo ſad a ſpectacle. Thus when <hi>Iphigenia</hi> was to be ſacrificed to <hi>Diana, Agamemnon</hi> ſtanding aloofe off, when he ſaw his daughter to be brought to the Altar, he could no longer endure it, but as <hi>Euripides</hi> writes,<note place="margin">Euripid. in Iphig.</note> he turned away his head, he drowned his eyes in tears, he covered his face, and all that he might not ſee his daughter ſacrificed. How then would he have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, if he himſelfe ſhould have done it? for ſo muſt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> if God had put it to <hi>Abrahams</hi> choiſe whether he would have offered himſelfe, or his ſon, no doubt he would have thought, that God had dealt very graciouſly with him, and that God had ſet <hi>Iſaac</hi> but at too low a rate, ſeeing he might purchaſe his life with the loſſe of his own: for <hi>Abraham</hi> was old, and therefore would willingly have yielded his life unto God, which he muſt of neceſſity have yielded unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not long after. But God will not be content with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> death, but with the death of his ſon, for he knew it would be worſe then death unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> to live without <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> but a thouſand times more grievous when he himſelfe ſhould kill him. For what might <hi>Abraham</hi> think with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt parricide that ever was, and <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be the ſecond. When <hi>Cain</hi> had murdred his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he thought he had committed ſuch an abominable act, that every one that ſaw him, would be ready to kill him, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever findes me, ſaith <hi>Cain will slay me.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> might well imagine, that this would make him odious among his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118276:9"/>neighbours, and that every one would count him as an enemy to nature, and as one that were not worthy to live among them. If but any bruit beaſt ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> do kill their young, we ſtand amazed at it, we count it prodigious, and that is portends ſome ſtrange event, we offer ſacrifice to appeaſe the Gods, that they may defend us from it. For we know, ſaith he, that nature hath taught them to love their young, and not to deſtroy them. And would not every man then exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Abraham?</hi> Is not this that <hi>Hebrew</hi> that murdred his ſon? is not this he, who as ſhort a time as he hath ſo journed in our Land, hath made the whole Countrey to ring of his cruelty? are theſe his good works? Lord, how preciſe he ſeem'd amongſt us? how ready to reprove us of impiety and prophaneſſe? and ſhall we harbour among us ſuch a monſter in nature, as ſeems to make a ſcruple of the leaſt ſins, and makes no conſcience of murder? Thus every one would be ready to crie out againſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet ſuch was his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that he had rather become odious amongſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſhew himſelfe cruell in killing his ſon, then ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious in diſobeying God. <hi>Scelus enim eſt</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine) filium occidere, ſed Deum ſceleſtius non audire,</hi> It is a ſin for a father to kill his ſon, but a greater ſin, if he kill not his ſon when God commands him.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> The Doctrine which may be gathered from hence, is this, <hi>That God makes triall of our obedience, according to the meaſure of his gifts and graces which he hath beſtowed upon us.</hi> For ſo we ſee, he deals here with <hi>Abraham,</hi> A light temptation had not been fit for ſo great a Patriarch, and therefore as God had extraordinarily enricht him with the graces of his Spirit, ſo he makes an extraordinary triall of his faith and obedience. For God deals with us, as a School-maſter is wont to deale with his ſchollars, who examines not every one alike, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they proceed and profit in learning, ſo he ſtill puts them to further exerciſes. If God ſhould lay any grievous triall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are weak, and not ſtrengthened in faith, it were enough to diſcourage them: if light and eaſie upon thoſe that were ſtrong, it were not enough to make manifeſt their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which lye hidden in them. And therefore he proportions his trials of our faith, to that meaſure of grace which he hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118276:10"/>vouchſafed us. When then we ſee, what God here requires of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we may admire Gods goodneſſe and mercy towards us, who ſpares our infirmity; and makes not the like triall of our obedience: For if God ſhould lay the leaſt of thoſe trials upon us, which he laid upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> how unable were we to undergo the ſame? And this we may ſee, if we examine our ſelves as touching our obedience in ſmaller matters. If God do but viſite us with any tedious and long ſickneſſe, or if he lay upon us any croſſe or affliction by taking our goods, or our children from us, preſently we fall into great impatience, and we think that God deals very hardly with us. How then would we bear it, if he ſhould make the like triall of us, which he makes here of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and if he ſhould command us for the proofe of our obedience, to kill our children with our own hands, and to offer them unto him? yet <hi>Abraham</hi> went willingly about the ſame.</p>
            <p>If the loſs of our goods will ſo overcome our patience, as many times it doth, what then would we ſay, if God ſhould lay upon us that which he laid upon <hi>Job,</hi> when he took both his goods &amp; his children from him, and when of all that ever he had he left him nothing; yet <hi>Job</hi> bleſt God when he had taken away all. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath given,</hi>

               <hi>and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> In a word, if a little pain in the time of our ſickneſſe will ſo bereave us of patience, what then would we do, if God ſhould lay upon us, that which he hath laid upon thouſands of our betters, I mean thoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres in the time of perſecution, whereof ſome have had their fleſh torne by piece-meale from their bodies with hot pincers, ſome have had their bodies cut aſunder with ſawes, and others have endured whatſoever the wit of man, or the malice of Satan could invent againſt them, and yet they have triumphed in the midſt of their torments. So that this may teach us to extoll and magnifie Gods goodneſſe towards us, who layeth not ſo much upon us as he laid upon them, but proportions his trials to our infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>And thus much likewiſe for the ſecond difficulty in this Commandement, in regard of the party that muſt offer this ſacrifice, <hi>Abraham Iſaac,</hi> a father his ſonne.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">difficulty. </seg>third</label> The third difficulty, is in regard of the manner how he muſt ſacrifice his ſon, he muſt offer him to God <hi>(in holocan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum) for a burnt-offring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner how they were to offer their burnt-offrings in the old Law, is preſcribed by God unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where we finde that the burnt-offring that was to be offered, was to be killed, to be cut in pieces or quartered, and every part to be laid upon the fire till it were wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Whether <hi>Abraham</hi> when he had killed his ſon, was likewiſe to quarter him, and to hew him in pieces, I will not determine? but yet it is probable. For howſoever the manner of offering theſe offrings was ſpecified long after this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was given, yet <hi>Abel</hi> and others had offered burnt offrings long before, which no doubt they had done as God himſelfe had taught them. But this is certain, that when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had killed his ſon with his own hands, he was likewiſe to lay him upon the fire, till he were wholly conſumed, and burnt to aſhes; for ſo much the word <hi>holocauſtum</hi> ſignifies. And therefore <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaith upon this place, <hi>(Non ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immolare filium jubetur Abraham, ſed offerre in holocauſtum, hoc eſt, &amp;c. Abraham</hi> is not commanded ſimply to ſacrifice his ſon, but to offer him for a burnt-offring, that is, ſaith <hi>Muſculus,</hi> after that he hath imbrued his ſword in his ſons bloud, with his own hands to lay his body in the fire, and when one ſide is burnt to turn the other, and ſo to let it burn till it be conſumed to aſhes, which is all one, as if his body were to be conſumed to nothing. So that this is more horrible then all the reſt. For how is it poſſible for a father to endure, when he hath bathed his ſword in his ſons bloud, to take him up in his armes, and to lay him upon the Altar, to ſee his bowels fry and crackle in the fire, and to turn him upſide down, till every part be conſumed and burnt to nothing? What death can be imagined ſo horrible as this? If God had commanded <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> either to have ſtrangled or ſmoothered his ſon, yet his body (ye know) would have remained whole, &amp; he might have entombed him: if God had commanded him to caſt him down headlong from the top of the mountain, ſo that every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber had been daſhed aſunder, yet ſome part of his body would have been remaining. Nay if God had commanded him to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118276:11"/>take his ſon, and caſt him to the wilde beaſts, that they might devoure him, yet at leaſt-wiſe, ye know, his bones would have been left, and ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> might have had ſome relique of his ſon, but this is ſuch a death as doth utterly conſume every part of the body, and brings all to nothing. But beſides this, <hi>Abraham</hi> knew very well, that God could not away with humane ſacrifices, and therefore that <hi>Abel, Noah</hi> and the reſt, had never offered the like in any of their offrings. It is true indeed, that many years after, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had learn'd of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (as we ſee <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 106) to ſacrifice their ſons and their daughters to divels,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37.</note> but therefore ſaith <hi>David, The wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt them, ſo that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred even his own inheritance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.40.</note> Nay this is ſo monſtrous and abominable an act, that many of the heathen did utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it. We read of the <hi>Carthagincans,</hi> that they were wont to ſacrifice their children to <hi>Saturne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch. in Reg. Apophth.</note> as thinking that this would be acceptable to their God, becauſe they had heard the fable, that <hi>Saturne</hi> was wont to devoure his children. But therefore when <hi>Gelo</hi> the King of <hi>Sicilia</hi> had ſubdued <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> he forbad this cuſtome, as thinking it monſtrous, that the gods ſhould be worſhipt with ſuch cruell ſacrifices. And therefore when <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Ageſilai.</note> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> records, was admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a dream to ſacrifice his daughter to <hi>Diana,</hi> as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had done, he made this anſwer, that he would not imitate <hi>Agamemnons</hi> folly, but he would offer ſuch a ſacrifice as was fit for a goddeſſe. How then could <hi>Abraham</hi> think that God would be pleaſed with ſuch a ſacrifice, and that he who is the father of mercies, and would not ſo much as the death of a ſinner, ſhould delight in cruelty, and in the ſlaughter of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents? ſo that when God commands <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſon, here is a further temptation then all the former, which ſeems not ſo much to impugne his affection, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his faith, in that God here ſeems contrary unto himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And indeed beloved, the conflict which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his affection, was nothing to that which his faith ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained. For how ſhould he believe the promiſes of God concerning his ſon, being now commanded by God to kill him.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118276:11"/>
            <p>God had promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> as we heard before, that him ſeed ſhould be called in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that he would multiply his ſeed, like the ſtarres of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.4.</note> and that he would eſtabliſh his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Iſaac</hi> for an everlaſting Covenant, and with his feed after him. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed according to <hi>Gods</hi> promiſe, that the Saviour of the World ſhould ſpring from his Sonne, and that ſo all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in him; and yet now he commands him to ſacrifice his Son, and ſo to burn as it were the bond of his own ſalvation. For if <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt die, how can <hi>Abraham</hi> look for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> from him? and if no <hi>Meſſias,</hi> what remaines but Gods wrath and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be powred upon all men? ſo that this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemes quite to overthrow Gods former promiſe; and yet ſuch was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and obedience, that he both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that which God had commanded, and withall believed that which God had promiſed. For howſoever it might ſeeme as impoſſible to fleſh and blood, that ſeed ſhould be raiſed from <hi>Iſaac</hi> being dead, as that a Tree ſhould budde forth, when the root is withered, yet he knew there was nothing impoſſible with God; and therefore though <hi>Iſaac</hi> were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed and burnt to nothing, yet that God was able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of his aſhes to raiſe up ſeed unto him.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118276:12"/>any evil, being as ill or worſe then the evil it ſelfe. But God here, the more as it may ſeeme to torment <hi>Abraham,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him not onely to Sacrifice his Son, but injoynes him a long and tedious journey before he muſt do it. God might have appointed him. Firſt, to go with his Son into the Land of <hi>Moriah,</hi> and being come thither, then he might have told him the cauſe of his coming. But firſt he commands him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his <hi>Son,</hi> and then ſends him to the place where he muſt perform the ſame: and what is the Reaſon but onely this, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>ut dum ambulat, dum iter agit, per totam viam cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationibus diſcerpatur,</hi> that all the while he is travelling with his <hi>Son,</hi> he might ruminate upon that which he went about, and be confounded in a manner with the remembrance of it.</p>
            <p>Now concerning this place where <hi>Abraham</hi> was appointed to ſacrifice his Sonne, ſome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> report, that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had offered their offrings upon the ſame Mountain. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> writes, that he had heard it for certain of ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jewes,</hi> that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was offered in the very ſame place, where afterwards our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> addes that he had heard it reported, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified in the very ſame place where <hi>Adam</hi> had been buried, and therefore that it was called <hi>Calvaria locus,</hi> the place of a dead mans skull, <hi>quia caput humani generis ibi dicitur eſſe ſepultum,</hi> becauſe the head of mankind lieth there buried The <hi>Saracens</hi> (who will needes borrow their name from <hi>Sarah,</hi> though they came of <hi>Hagar</hi>) to make it more profitable that they ſprang from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they faine that the land of <hi>Moriah</hi> is a part of their Country, and therefore when any ſtranger comes to their City of <hi>Mecha</hi> to ſee <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sepulcher, hard by the City, they do ſhew him the Mountain, where on <hi>Abraham</hi> as they ſay, did ſacrifice his Sonne. But the truth is, that the Land of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> where <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be offered, was the ſame which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as we may plainly gather out of the ſecond of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.</note> the third Chapter; for there it is ſaid in the firſt verſe, that <hi>Salomon</hi> built the Temple of the Lord in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in Mount <hi>Moriah:</hi> So that the place where <hi>Iſaac</hi> was to be offered, was either the ſame, or very near to the place, where our Saviour was afterwards to be crucified. And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118276:12"/>indeed it was not unfit, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be offred where our Saviour was to ſuffer, becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a type and figure of our Saviour. So ſaith St. <hi>Augustine, Abraham, quando filium ſuum obtulit, typum habuit Dei Patris, Iſaac typum geſſit Domini Salvatoris. Abraham</hi> when he offered his Sonne repreſented God the Father, <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he was offered repreſented our Saviour the Son of God. For many things which wore ſhadowed forth in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> were afterwards verefied in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As the promiſes of <hi>God</hi> unto <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning his Son, were often renewed, and his birth foretold; ſo were the promiſes and the birth of the Meſſias. As <hi>Iſaacs</hi> was named before he was borne, ſo was alſo <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Birth was ſtrange and miraculous, in regard that he was borne of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that was barren; ſo was alſo <hi>Chriſts</hi> being borne of a virgin. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> onely Son, whom he ſo dearly loved; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the onely begotten Son of God, in whom alone he was wel pleaſed. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> was cauſeleſs to be put to death, ſo was <hi>Chriſt</hi> being innocent. As <hi>Iſaac</hi> bore the wood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was to be ſacrificed, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> bore the Tree whereon he was to be crucified. In a word, as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> by yielding himſelf to be offred, did teſtifie his obedience unto his Fathe, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his wonderful love unto God: ſo <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by ſubmitting himſelf to the death, declared his wonderfull obedience unto, God, and God his unſpeakable love towards us.</p>
            <p>And indeed beloved, this is the moſt excellent uſe that can poſſibly be made of this whole Hiſtory; when we hear how <hi>Abraham</hi> did offer his Son, we ſtand amazed at it, we wonder how it was poſſible for a Father to do it: And may we not much more admire the infinite love of God unto us, in giving his onely begotten Son to be crucified for us. When we hear how <hi>Iſaac</hi> yielded himſelf to be bound and offered, we cannot but wonder at his ſtrange obedience: and may we not much more wonder at the infinite obedience of our bleſſed Saviour, who being equall with God, yet humbled himſelf and became obedient, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ven to the death of the Croſſe? <hi>Abraham</hi> when he offered his Sonne unto God, he did but reſtore unto God that which God had given him, &amp; he might wel the rather be moved thereunto; becauſe God had been alwaies ſo gracious to him; But when God gave his Son to be offered for us, we were ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118276:13"/>far from having deſerved any thing at his hands, that we were his open and profeſt enemies. <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he yielded himſelf to be offered, yet he yielded himſelf into his Fathers hands, who was to preſent him for a ſweet ſavour unto the Lord; and ſo to put him to a kind of death, which of all other might ſeene the moſt glorious: But Chriſt when he yielded himſelf to be offered, he yielded himſelf into the hands of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who he knew would not onely put him to the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious death; but for his further vexation, even deride him in his torments: When <hi>Abraham</hi> was to ſacrifice his onely Sonne, God was ſo moved with compaſſion and pitty, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his Sonne he provided a Ramme; Indeed it was fitter that a Ram ſhould dye, if the death of a Ramme might ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a Sonne: But when Chriſt was to be offered the caſe was altered; the Ramme was ſpared, and the Sonne was ſacrificed; Nay, the Sonne was therefore ſacrificed, that the Ram might be ſpared.</p>
            <p>Read over all the Hiſtories of Heathen Authours, examine their writings, ſearch out all their antiquities, and ſee if there were ever the like example of love: For a man to die for his friend it is no ſmall matter, and but few have done it; but if one ſhould offer to dye for a ſtranger we would wonder at it; O but for a man to dye for his enemy, nay, the Sonne of God to come down from Heaven, even from his Fathers boſome, to dye a moſt accurſed death for his enemy; this is that love of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, and can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſt either by men or Angels.</p>
            <p>And yet, that we may in ſome meaſure conceive a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this infinite Love of God; ſuppoſe with thy ſelf, that thou being a poor and a ſilly creature, ſhouldſt live under the Dominion of ſome mighty Emperour, who had made this Law; That whoſoever ſhould be found guilty of high Treaſon, ſhould be put to the moſt exquiſite torments that could be imagined, and that thou afterwards (having received many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from him) ſhouldſt give eare notwithſtanding to ſome of his Nobility, and willingly joyne with them in Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: And being both convicted of the ſame, he ſhould execute the utmoſt of his fury upon his Nobility; but caſt with himſelf how he might ſave thee. And finding no other meanes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118276:13"/>for thy deliverance, he ſhould give his onely beloved ſon, the ſole Heir of his Kingdom, to ſuffer the muſt ſhamefull and accurſed death of all other for thy ranſome; who willingly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame upon him, ſhould never ſpeak ſo much as one word in the behalf of his Nobility, but onely plead and ſue for thee, that thou by his death mightſt not onely be forgiven; but likewiſe mighteſt be made Heir of his Fathers Kingdom. What now wouldſt thou think of his love unto thee? How wouldſt thou wonder at it? How would thy ſoule be raviſht when thou thoughteſt upon it? Beloved, ſuch and farr great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the love of God unto thee, if thou canſt apply it. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that were farre more glorious creatures, made to attend upon God and to be in his preſence, yet God ſpared not them, when they had but once, and that onely in thought rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; but as for thee, though thou hadſt often rebelled againſt him; yet God hath given his onely begotten Sonne, to dye in thy roome, that thou mighteſt inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. And this was that reall ſacrifice which was here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by <hi>Abrahams</hi> off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was come to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and had already ſtretcht forth his hand to have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed his ſonne, God preſently forbad him; becauſe onely the death of our bleſſed Saviour and not <hi>Iſaacs</hi> death was a price ſufficient for our redemption.

            <p>The laſt difficulty in this commandement, is in regard of the time when he muſt ſacrifice his Sonne, <hi>Take now thine onely Son,</hi> namely, now when he was old and his wife paſt Bearing; and therefore hopeleſſe of having any other children, now he muſt ſacrifice his onely Sonne.</p>
            <p>We read in <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Herod, Thalia.</note> that when <hi>Intaphernes,</hi> one of the privy Councell of King <hi>Darius,</hi> had offended the King, the King commanded that both he and his whole family ſhould be put to death; but being moved with the complaints of his wife he both ſpared her, and withall gave her the choice, which of them all ſhe would chooſe to deliver. She having a while deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated upon it, reſolved in the end to make choiſe for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the King demanding why ſhe ſued not rather for her husband or children, ſhe made this anſwer; that though her husband or children ſhould dye, yet ſhe being young might marry again, and ſo might have more; but if her brother were put to death now that her parents were dead, ſhe was ſure ſhe ſhould never have any other brother. If God had given <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> a child, while himſelf and <hi>Sarah,</hi> his wife had been young &amp; had then commanded him to have put him to death; yet his loſſe had been the leſſe, in that he might have hoped to have had more children; but they both being old when he was to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they could not hope for any other after him.</p>
            <p>Fathers ſaith <hi>Philo,</hi> when they come to be old, of all their children they make moſt of their youngeſt;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philo</hi> lib. de <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                  <hi>Joſeph.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>Antigen.</hi>
               </note> was a hundred yeare old, and <hi>Sarah</hi> was ninety before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was now (as JOSEPHUS writes) five and twenty yeare old, when he was to be offered; and therefore they, being ſtruck ſo far in years might well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was their firſt: ſo he was like to be their laſt that they ſhould have between them; So that <hi>Abrahams</hi> grief muſt needs be the greater in regard of the time, when he was commanded to ſacrifice his Sonne.</p>
            <p>But to come more directly to the time, it is ſaid in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er verſe, that after theſe things God did prove <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118276:14"/>ſaid unto him, <hi>Take now thine onely Sonne,</hi> namely, after that God (as we ſee in the former chapter) had had notable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, by calling out <hi>Jſhmael</hi> his firſt begotten; now he layes a new task upon him, &amp; far more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous then the former was; <hi>Now</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Take thine onely Son,</hi> as though he ſhould have ſaid, I have made heretofore ſome tryall of thine obedience in ſmaller matters. I commanded thee to leave thy native Country and thou haſt left it; I bad thee to caſt <hi>Jſhmael</hi> out of dores with his mother, and thou haſt done it, <hi>deeſt adbuc vnum,</hi> yet there is one thing wanting, now that thou haſt done all this, now thou muſt ſacrifice thine onely Sonne.

The leaſt of theſe tryalls was very hard to be overcome; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> like a Gyant that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth to run his courſe, roſe up early in the morning &amp; went about it: and having a full reſolution to ſacrifice his Sonne, as God commanded, he concealed his purpoſe from his wife, and his Servants, leſt they ſhould have hindered him from the execution of it.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>5</label> The Doctrine that may be gathered from hence is this, <hi>That God the better to ſound the hearts of his Servants, makes often try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their obedience; and after that one tryall is paſt and over, he layeth another upon them for their further exerciſe.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118276:15"/>their places but preſently there comes another and brings him worſe tydings, that the fire fell from Heaven and conſumed his Servants; and preſently after, he heares worſe newes then the former, that while his children were together at a banquet, the houſe fell upon them all ſo that not one of them eſcaped. And this is the condition of Gods ſervants, many are the tryalls which they are to endure and the end of one tryall is many times but the beginning of another; For we ſerve not God with this condition, that after he hath laid one tryall upon us, and we have borne the ſame, we ſhould crave as it were a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſeek to be diſcharged from any-further ſervice; but whatſoever it is that God requires at our hands, and how often ſoever; yet we muſt be ready with <hi>Abraham</hi> to performe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>The comfort is this, that though the tryalls which God layes upon us be never ſo many; yet God will enable us to bear the ſame.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> For <hi>God is faithfull,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above our power; but will give an iſſue with the temptation that we may be able to bear it:</hi> and when we have borne it, he hath promiſed to reward us, and that infinitly for it. <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi>

            <p>The Word of God is reſembled to divers things in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.<note place="margin">

For ſeed is no more neceſſary to make the earth fructifie and give her increaſe, then the ſeed of Gods Word to make us fruitfull in all good Works, Ye know, if the Earth do not give her increaſe, there followes a Famin; if ſeed be wanting, and the Earth not ſowen, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give her increaſe: And thus where the ſeed of Gods Word is wanting, there followes a dearth of all ſpirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>And therefore as we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. of a dearth or famine for want of ſeed:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.19. <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4.</note> ſo likewiſe we read <hi>Amos</hi> 8. of a dearth or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for want of the Word; for man cannot live by bread onely, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. God is able indeed to make us fruitfull, without the preaching of the word, as he made the Earth fruitfull at the firſt Creation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5.</note> without the ſowing of ſeed: he is able to ſave us when his word is wanting by ſome other meanes, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with <hi>Manna</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> when they had not the ordinary meanes of tillage; but the ordinary meanes to make the Earth fruitfull, is the ſowing of Seed, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes to make us fruitfull, is the preaching of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118276:16"/>Word. And therefore in thoſe places where the People are not taught, or the word is neglected, we may ſee them abound in ſuperſtition and ignorance, and all the unfruitfull works of darkneſs, even as <hi>Salomon</hi> paſſing by the field of the ſluggard, he ſaw it all over growen with thornes and nettles;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>John</hi> 4.35. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11.</note> we may ſee the Regions even white unto Harveſt, and filled as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks with the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>

So that the firſt meanes of a good ground, is the receiving of ſeed or the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may gather many profitable inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly concerning the Preachers of the Word, the Sowers of this Seed; and partly concerning the Hearers of the Word, the ground that receives it.</p>

               </label> And firſt, For the Preacher, ſeeing the Word of <hi>God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to Seed, that therefore he omit no fit opportunity of preaching the Word.</p>
            <p>The Sower ye know when Seed-time comes, he layeth all other buſineſs whatſoever aſide, and betakes himſelf wholly to the ſowing of his ground, as knowing that there is a time to ſowe, and a time to reape. Firſt to ſowe and then to reape, and never any reaping unleſs there have been ſowing. And thus we muſt omit no fit opportunity of preaching, nay we muſt be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, expecting no Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt where the ſeed of Gods Word hath not firſt been ſowen. The leſſe paines the <hi>Husbandman</hi> takes with his ground, and the thinner he ſowes it, the thinner the Corne muſt needes come up, and he cannot but expect the leſſe fruit of it. And thus the leſſe paines we take with our auditors, the leſſe we inſtruct them, we cannot but expect the leſſe fruit of them. And therefore in the morning (ſaith the <hi>Preacher</hi>) <hi>ſowe thy Seed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> iii. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and in the evening withhold not thy hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Seeing the word is reſembled to Seed, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118276:17"/>we ſowe nothing but the Seed of Gods vvord. The Sower ye know before he ſowes his Seed, he vvill firſt ſift and vvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novv it, he vvill cleanſe it at home before he come into the field, and he vvill take avvay the chaffe and the refuſe from it. And thus before vve come into the Pulpit, vve muſt examine the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that vve are to deliver, vve muſt vveigh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate vvhat vve are to ſpeak, that nothing paſſe from us but the pure Word of God.</p>
            <p>In the 23. of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> the 28. <hi>verſe, The Prophet</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word faithfully, what is the Chaffe to the Wheat</hi> ſaith the Lord?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Seeing the Word is reſembled to Seed, it ſhewes to what end we are to preach the Word: namely, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of thoſe that heare it. The Sovver ye knovv, vvhen he ſowes his Seed, he propounds no other end to himſelf but this, that he may make the Earth fructifie and give her increaſe: and thus the end of our preaching muſt be the good of our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not to ſhew learning, wit or eloquence, or to purchaſe credit and reputation to our ſelves, but to make them fruitfull in good works. Therefore the Sower to make his ground the more fruitfull, he firſt conſiders the nature of his ground, and ſowes it with that Seed which is fitteſt for it, every ſoile being not fit for every ſeed; but one for <hi>Barley,</hi> another for <hi>Wheat:</hi> and thus, that our preaching may be the more profitable; we muſt apply our ſelves to the quality of our hearers, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Doctrine is fitteſt for them: We ſpeak wiſdom, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> among them that are perfect; but to you, ſaith he, that are Babes in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, for the ground that receives this ſeed, the hearer of the Word: Seeing the hearing of the Word is the receiving of ſeed, therefore we are firſt to be fitted and prepared before we hear the Word. The ground ye know before it be ſowen, it muſt be firſt plowed and broken up; otherwiſe it is not fit to receive the ſeed. And thus before we heare the Word, we muſt break up (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks) the follow ground of our hearts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3.</note> otherwiſe we are not fit to hear the Word. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the reaſon, why the ſeed of <hi>Gods</hi> Word is leſſe fruitfull,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118276:17"/>in ſome then it is in others, is becauſe they are not fitted and prepared alike to hear the word. The ſeed which fell before by the high-way ſide, and the ſeed which fell upon the ſtony ground, as likewiſe the ſeed which fell among thornes, the ſeed was all alike, and altogether as good, as the ſeed which fell here into good ground, and the ſower was the ſame that ſowed the ſeed: yet in the one it became fruitfull, &amp; in none of the other: and what is the reaſon? no difference in the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no difference in the ſeed, but only in the ground, the ground being not fitted and diſpoſed alike to receive the ſeed. And thus where the ſeed of Gods Word is ſown, though the Preacher and Doctrine be both the ſame, yet it is fruitfull in one, and not in another, and not by any defect in the Word, or him that delivers it, but by default of the hearer, as being not fitly diſpoſed and prepared to hear the Word. Therefore when the people were to hear the Law, God commanded <hi>Moſes Exod.</hi> 19. to ſanctifie the people three dayes before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10.11.</note> that they might be the better prepared to hear it. If we have but a field or piece of ground of our own to be ſowne with ſeed, we will firſt trimme and dreſſe it, we will pick out the ſtones, and root up the weeds, before we ſow any ſeed in it. So carefull we are that our ſeed be not loſt, how carefull (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) then ought we to be that Gods Seed be not loſt? and therefore <hi>not to harden our hearts if we will hear his voice;</hi> but to come with prepared and ſanctified affections,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7.8.</note> that we may be the more fit to receive his Word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Seeing the hearing of the word is the receiving of ſeed, therefore we are to be diligent in hearing the word. Seed, though it be neceſſary to make the earth fructifie, yet it hath not this vertue, unleſſe it be ſowne, and the earth receive it; while it lies in our barns, or is laid up in our Garners, it yields no increaſe, and hath not any power to make the earth fruitfull. And thus it is likewiſe with the Seed of Gods word, though it be the means to make us fruitful in the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, yet it hath not this vertue, before it be heard &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of us, while it lies in our houſes, or is lockt up in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, it hath no ſuch effect, but by hearing thereof it becomes fruitfull in us. For the word muſt firſt take root in the heart
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118276:18"/>before it can ftuctifie, it cannot come into the heart but by the eare, the eare being as it were the doore where the word muſt enter. Therefore when <hi>Moſes Deut.</hi> 5. was to repeat the Law unto the people, to ſhew them how they were to receive the Law, he begins the ſame with <hi>Hear O Iſrael.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Solomon</hi> will teach us wiſdome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 10.4.</note> no marvell though the word be not fruitfull in us. For as the ground cannot fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie without the receiving of ſeed, no more can we without the hearing of the word.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Seeing the hearing of the word is the receiving of ſeed, it ſhews us from whence the hearing of the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fruitfull in us, not from any vertue that we have in our ſelves, but from Gods bleſſing; as the ground which is ſowne cannot bring forth fruit, but by the influence and vertue which it receives from heaven. The ground, ye know, when it hath been ſowne with ſeed, muſt have the rain from heaven to moiſten it, it muſt have the heat of the Sun to cheriſh it, otherwiſe it becomes fruitleſſe, and yields no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. And thus unleſſe God give a bleſſing to his word, unleſſe he mollifie our hearts, and illuminate our minds, the word which we have heard cannot fructifie in us. <hi>For Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but it is God that muſt give the increaſe.</hi> And therefore as the ground when it hath been ſown with ſeed, if it be but a while without the rain, it will thirſt after it, it will open as it were the mouth, and gape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, with a longing deſire to be refreſht with it: and when the blade comes forth, it will ſeem even to droop, and to hang down the head, till the Sun do ſtrengthen it. So muſt we be affected when we have heard the word, we muſt long for a bleſſing from heaven upon it; we muſt pray unto
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118276:18"/>God for the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, and we muſt thirſt after grace, even <hi>as the heart doth bray after the rivers of water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1</note> 
               <hi>and as the dry land doth thirſt after rain in the drought of Summer.</hi> And thus much for the firſt means of a good ground, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of ſeed, or the hearing of the word.</p>
            <p>The ſecond means of a good ground, is the receiving in of the ſeed, or the underſtanding of the word.</p>
            <p>The ground though ſeed be ſown upon it, yet if the ſeed ſtay there, and go no further, and if the ground recieve not the ſeed into it, it muſt needs be fruitleſſe. And thus though we hear the word of God, yet unleſſe it do pierce further then the outward eare, unleſſe what we hear with our ears, we underſtand with our hearts, the ſeed of Gods Word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fructifie in us. And therefore Saint <hi>James</hi> by an other like metaphor wils us to receive (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Word; to note unto us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>James</hi> 1.21.</note> the Word muſt likewiſe be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in the heart like a ſience in a ſtock, before it can bear and bring forth fruit. The ſeed which fell before upon the ſtony ground, ſoon withered away, and became fruitleſſe, and our Saviour gives this as the reaſon of it, becauſe it had no root. For though we hear the word never ſo often, yet till the underſtanding be informed, and the heart affected, our ſuperficial hearing will profit us nothing. Therefore when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did preach at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and converted <hi>Lydia,</hi> it is ſaid there, that <hi>God opened her heart, ſo that ſhe attended unto that which he ſpake.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118276:19"/>Miniſter ought to preach as plainly as he can, and to do his beſt indeavour to ſpeak ſo perſpicuouſly, that the ſimpleſt in his auditorie may underſtand him.

For like as the ground when it hath been ſowen with ſeed, it will ſhew it ſelf by the fruit thereof, whether it be a fertill or a barren ſoile; ſo when a man hath been taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the word, he will ſhew by the fruits which he brings forth, whether he be a profitable or a fruitleſs hearer.</p>
            <p>The ground therefore when it hath been ſowen, it firſt ceaſeth to bring forth thornes and bryers, and is not ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118276:21"/>in thiſtles and weedes as it was before. And thus when a man hath been inſtructed in the word, if he be a profitable hearer thereof, the word will have this operation in him, that firſt he will relinquiſh his former vices, and will not be ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to commit any evill as he was before.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. ii.</note> 
               <hi>I have hid,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, thy word in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> So that this is one fruit and effect of the word, that it will make a man leave and forſake ſinne.</p>
            <p>If heretofore thou haſt been given to ſwearing, yet when this ſeed of the word hath been ſowen in thy heart,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7.</note> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Oaths the Land ſhall mourne, and that <hi>God will not hold him guiltleſs that takes his name in vaine,</hi> this will cauſe thee to make a Conſcience of Oaths, and will roote out this weed of unneceſſary ſwearing.</p>
            <p>If heretofore thou haſt ſlander'd and defamed thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and wronged him in his good name and reputation; yet when this ſeed of the word hath been ſowen in thy heart, That a falſe witneſs ſhall not be unpuniſhed, and he that ſpeakes lies ſhall not eſcape:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.5.</note> this will root out this weed of ſlander and detraction.</p>
            <p>In a word, what ſinne ſoever thou haſt committed heretofore, yet when the ſeed of Gods word hath been ſowen in thy heart, it will root it out, and cauſe thee to leave it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ground when it hath been ſowen with ſeed, it not onely leaves bringing forth evill fruit, but likewiſe it brings forth good fruit; it not onely ceaſeth from bringing forth weedes, but it brings forth, Corne for the uſe of man.</p>
            <p>And thus he that is a profitable hearer of the word, he will not onely mortifie the deedes of the fleſh, but he will likewiſe bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit, he will not onely leave evil, but he will do good.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Titus</hi> 2. ii.</note> 
               <hi>The grace of God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, which brings ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts</hi> (there is the former fruit of the word, the leaving of evil) and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world (there is the other, the doing of good.) Gods word herein being like a ſweet perfume, which not onely takes away the evil ſent, but leaves a ſweet ſent in the roome of it.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:118276:21"/>
            <p>If heretofore thou haſt had an overweening conceit of thy ſelf, and haſt been poſſeſt with pride and arrogancie, yet when the ſeed of Gods word hath taken root in thy heart, it wil not onely diſpoſſeſs and roote out pride, but in the roome thereof it will place humility: So that thou wilt be little in thine own eyes, and think thy ſelf with St. <hi>Paul</hi> the leaſt of all others. If heretofore thou haſt lived in hatred and enmity, yet when the ſeed of Gods word hath taken root in thy heart, it wil not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove and root out hatred, but in the roome thereof it wil place charity: So that thou wilt bleſſe them that curſe thee, thou wilt do good to thoſe that hate thee, and thou wilt pray with St. <hi>Steven</hi> for them that perſecute thee.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60.</note> And thus in a word, whereſoever this ſeed hath taken root, it will not onely weed out the former vices, but it wil place in their roome the contrary virtues.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. The ground when it hath been ſowen with ſeed, as it leaves bringing forth evil fruit, and brings forth that which is good, ſo it deferrs not the bringing forth fruit, but brings forth the ſame at the expected time. And thus he that is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable hearer of the word, as he will abſtain from that which is evil, and do that which is good: So he wil not defer the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, but in a ſeaſonable time he wil bring forth the fruits which are required of him. When occaſion is offered him of doing any good, whether ſuch as concernes him after a more general manner, as he is a Chriſtian, or more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of his calling, he will take the opportunity, and bring forth his fruit in a ſeaſonable time. If God have increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy wealth and ſubſtance, and given thee ſufficient, not onely for thy ſelf, but for the relief of others; when thou ſeeſt the hungry that would be glad of the Crums that fall from thy Table, when thou ſeeſt the naked and the ſtranger that want Clothing and Harbour, or any that are in any want and neceſſity, then thou haſt opportunity to do good, and if thon be this good ground which is here mencioned, then thou wilt bring forth the fruits of mercy.</p>
            <p>If God have given thee the tongue of the learned, and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thee to exhort with wholſome Doctrine, and to convince the gain-ſayers of it, when thou ſeeſt thy Brother ready to fall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118276:22"/>into error, and to make ſhip-wrack of faith and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then thou haſt opportunity to do good, and if thou be this ground which is here mentioned, then thou wilt bring forth the fruits of knowledge. If God have advanced thee to the place of Authority, and committed into thy hand the ſword of juſtice, when thou ſeeſt the poor to be deprived of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> right, and the innocent oppreſt; when thou ſeeſt iniquity to abound in the Land, and robbery and violence in all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then thou haſt opportunity to do good, and if thou be this good ground which is here mentioned, then thou wilt bring forth the fruits of juſtice.</p>
            <p>The ground indeed when it hath been ſowen, yet before it do bear and bring forth fruit, it ſhall have many impediments to hinder the groweth and increaſe thereof; it muſt undergoe many ſtormes and tempeſts, many froſts in winter, much ſcorching in Summer; but yet if it be a good and a fertil ſoile, it will overcome them all, and bring forth fruit at the time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>And thus when the ſeed of Gods word hath taken root in thy heart; yet before thou canſt bring forth the fruit thereof: thou ſhalt meet indeed with many lets and hinderances, partly from thine own unruly affections, and partly from others; but yet if thou be this good ground which is here mentioned, thou wilt overcome them all, and with the Tree that is deſcribed in the firſt <hi>Pſalme, Thou wilt bring forth fruit in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw then to a concluſion of this firſt ſigne, if fruitfulneſs be a ſigne of a good ground, then that we may not deceive our ſelves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1.</note> let us not onely be hearers of the word, but doers of it; let us not receive the grace of God in vain, but when the ſeed of Gods word hath been ſowen in our hearts. Let us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to practice the ſame, and to bring forth the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our lives. We would count him ye know a very bad Husband, who when his ground hath been ſowen with ſeed, ſhould turne in his ſwine to root it up, or when it is come forth and begins to ripen, ſhould let in his Beaſts to ſpoile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure it; what then beloved may we think of our ſelves, if when we have been partakers of the word of God, we give
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118276:22"/>way to our affections, and ſuffer the delights of the world, or the luſts of the fleſh, to hinder this ſeed from fructifying in us.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt ſigne of a good ground, that it brings forth fruit. I come now unto the ſecond, the quantity of fruit which it brings forth, <hi>ſome an hundred, ſome ſixty, ſome thirty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ground if it be good,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>it is not onely fruit full when it hath bin ſowen, but it yields as ye ſee, a very great increaſe, every ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed at the leaſt bearing thirty for one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus he that is a profitable hearer of the word, he is not onely fruitfull in the works of righteouſneſs, but he brings forth the ſame in great abundance. <hi>I,</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>Chriſt, am the vine, and ye are the branches, he that abides in me and I in him, the ſame brings forth much fruit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 15.5.</note> So that it is not enough to be fruitful, unleſs we be fruitful in ſome good meaſure. And now that we know what are the ſignes of a good ground, it remaines, that we try and examine our ſelves, whether we be this good ground or no. You will ſay, I have gotten this good, by hearing the word, that now when I heare it, I heare it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, I take delight in hearing it, is not this a good ſigne? ſurely this is but a good beginning; for thou mayſt heare the word, and that with delight, and yet be but an hypocrite; for ſo did <hi>Herod,</hi> he heard <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and he heard him glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet all the world knowes what <hi>Herod</hi> was.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 6.</note> You will ſay again, but I am gone further then ſo, for I do not onely hear the word, and that with delight; but I have left many ſinnes ſince I have heard the word; and is not this a good ſigne? ſurely this likewiſe is but a good beginning; for firſt, it is not enough to leave many ſinnes, unleſſe thou endeavour to leave all: otherwiſe, God that for one ſin of pride caſt the Angels out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> for one diſobedience thruſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and for one onely lye, ſhewed his judgement on <hi>Ananias,</hi> will likewiſe reject thee for any one ſin, if thou takeſt delight to continue in the ſame Secondly, as it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to leave many ſins, unleſs thou endeavour to leave all. So this is not ſufficient, unleſs as thou leave evil, ſo thou do good. For as that is not to be counted a good ground, which onely leaves bringing forth evil fruit, except it likewiſe bring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118276:23"/>forth good fruit: So God will not repute him for a good man, who onely leaves evil, but doth no good.</p>
            <p>The fruitleſs <hi>Fig-tree</hi> was curſed by our Saviour not becauſe it bore evill fruit, but becauſe it forbore to bring forth good fruit.</p>
            <p>The unprofitable Servant is condemned in the Goſpel, not becauſe he did evill with his Talent; for he onely hid it; but becauſe he did not do good therewith, he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it. In a word, to thoſe whom our Saviour placeth at his left hand at the day of judgement, he gives not this Reaſon; for when I was hungry, ye took away my meate, when I was a ſtranger, ye took away my lodging. But ſaith he, when I was hungry, ye did not give me to eat; and when I was a ſtranger, ye did not provide me Harbour. So that it is not enough for thee to leave evill, except thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do good. You wil ſay again, but I am gone further then the leaving of evill ſince I have heard the word; for I have done good. Come therefore unto the ſecond ſigne of a good ground and ſee whether thou haſt brought forth fruit, according to that meaſure which is here mentioned. Is thy knowledge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that which hath been taught thee? haſt thou brought forth the fruits of Faith and obedience, according to that meaſure of ſeed which thou haſt received, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the paines which have been taken with thee? You will ſay, this is a hard ſaying; for who is able to do the ſame? Know therefore for thy comfort, that if thou bring but forth fruit in ſome good meaſure, and if thou do but thy beſt endeavour to be more and more fruitfull, God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thy good endeavour: and though thou be not ſo fruitfull as ſome others are, yet this may be thy comfort, that God doth as well accept him for fruitfull that brings forth thirty, as he doth him that brings forth an hundred. And like as the Husbandman when he reapes his Corne, he will not refuſe and paſſe by thoſe eares, which are not ſo full as the reſt are, but will carry them all into the barne together: So God will not reject our imperfect obedience, but when he ſhall gather his Saints together, he will bring us all to thoſe heavenly manſions, whither Chriſt is gone before to provide them for us.</p>

And this prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was here fulfilled by our Saviour, by two notable miracles which he wrought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly one after the other; the one in the end of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Chapter, where he miraculouſly cured a blind-man: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the beginning of this Chapter, where he wrought a more miraculous cure, in the ſuddain converſion of a ſinfull <hi>Publican;</hi> thereby to teach us, that he indeed is that skillfull Phyſitian, that cures both our corporall and ſpirituall diſeaſes.

            <p>Now concerning this miracle that is wrought here by our

            <p>The place where this miracle was wrought, was, as we ſee in the firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> the City of <hi>Jericho;</hi> a City which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Joſhua, Joſh.</hi> 6.21. and afterwards re-edified by <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> came to <hi>Jericho,</hi> he came with an Army, he waſted the City and deſtroyed the Inhabitants which were grievous ſinners; but when Chriſt came to <hi>Jericho,</hi> though no doubt, there were as grievous ſinners in the City as there were before; yet he came not as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, to deſtroy them, but he came in mercy to convert and ſave them.</p>
            <p>The party upon whom this miracle was wrought, is ſet down by the Evangeliſt in the ſecond <hi>verſe,</hi> when we find him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed divers wayes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By his name, he was called <hi>Zacheus.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>The manner how his converſion was wrought, is ſet down by the Evangeliſt in the 4 <hi>verſes</hi> following. Where firſt we ſee that <hi>Zacheus</hi> had a deſire to ſee Chriſt, in the third <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he uſeth the meanes to ſee him, in the fourth <hi>ver. For when he perceived that he could not ſee Chriſt, by reaſon of the preaſſe of the people that flocked about him,</hi> Zacheus <hi>ranne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and climed up into a tree where Chriſt ſhould paſſe by, that ſo he might ſee him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts calling of him in the 5. <hi>verſe;</hi> For Chriſt underſtanding what an earneſt deſire <hi>Zacheus</hi> had to him, he calls him down, and offers himſelf not only to be ſeen, but to be entertained by him. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Come down, for to day I muſt abide at thy houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. His joyfull receiving and entertaining of Chriſt, in the ſixt <hi>verſe; for Chriſt had no ſooner called him down; but he came down haſtily,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>and received him joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>

            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118276:24"/>
            <p>The fruits and effects of his miraculous converſion, are ſet down here in this eighth <hi>verſe:</hi> and they are two, his mercy in giving, and his juſtice in making reſtitution; his mercy in giving, in the words of my Text, <hi>Behold Lord, the halfe of my goods I give to the poor.</hi> His juſtice in making reſtitution, in the next words following, <hi>And if I have taken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from any man by falſe accuſation, I reſtore him four-fold.</hi> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we may obſerve theſe four things.</p>

            <p>And fourthly, The time when he gives them to the poor: he gives them preſently without any delay, he gives them not upon his death-bed, or when he lies a dying, but he gives them now in the time of his health, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Who he was that gave this gift, we ſee, as I ſaid,<note place="margin">The Giver.</note> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>verſe.</hi> Where firſt the Evangeliſt ſets down his name, becauſe he is to ſpeak of his converſion, and becauſe it makes for his commendation which he is to ſpeak of him. For it is the wiſdome of the Evangeliſt, when he mentions any matter that tends to their diſgrace of whom it is ſpoken, <hi>Parcere perſonis dicere de vitiis,</hi> to ſpeak of their vices, but to conceal their names. Thus ſpeaking of the pride of the Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9. yet their names are concealed that they might not be diſgraced. <hi>He ſpake</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) <hi>this parable againſt certain that truſted in themſelves, and deſpiſed others; He ſpake</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>againſt certain,</hi> but he doth not name them. <hi>Thus ſpeaking of the rich glutton, Luke</hi> 16.19. <hi>that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118276:25"/>was tormented in hed for being unmerciful,</hi> he ſpares his name becauſe he would not defame him. <hi>There was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a certain rich man:</hi> but who he was, he doth not name, but preſently after ſpeaking of the begger, that was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, becauſe this made for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation he ſets down his name; <hi>And there was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a certain begger named Lazarus.</hi> And thus the Evangeliſt ſpeaks of <hi>Mary Magdalene, Luke</hi> 7.37. <hi>A certain woman,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the City which was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Becauſe he touches the looſeneſſe of her life, and calls her a ſinner, therefore he purpoſely conceales her name, as unwilling to defame her, by making her known; but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſpeaking of her following of Chriſt, and miniſtring unto him, becauſe this made for her commendation, he ſets down her name, and calls her <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> Which may teach us this leſſon, That we muſt neither maliciouſly make a mans name known, when we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any matter that may diſgrace him, nor yet enviouſly ſuppreſſe and conceale a mans name in a matter that tends to his juſt commendation. As becauſe it was commendable which <hi>Zacheus</hi> here did, the Evangeliſt names him. And as he deſcribes him by his name, ſo by his place or office, that he was the chiefe re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Now they among the <hi>Romans</hi> were called <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> whoſe office it was, to collect the tribute of the people, for the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours. And when the <hi>Jews</hi> became tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> many bought this office, and paying yearly unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> a certain ſumme of money for the tribute which they gathered among the <hi>Jews:</hi> whatſoever they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected was for themſelves, and therefore they exacted more then was due unto them, and ſo became infamous among the people for their intollerable extortion. And therefore when the <hi>Publicans, Luke</hi> 3. came among the reſt to be baptized of <hi>John,</hi> and demanded of him what they ſhould do, he made them this anſwer,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Require</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no more then that which is appointed you:</hi> as thinking that this was the beſt counſel which he could give them, to leave their unjuſt and unlawfull exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe this was the vice which was moſt ordinary among them: in regard whereof, the <hi>Publicans</hi> were alwayes had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> in the greateſt diſgrace of all others. And

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.</note> Noting thereby, that ſuch a man is incorrigible, and his caſe deſperate, and therefore that there is no more hope to be conceived of him, then there is of a Publican. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. reproving the chief Prieſts and the Elders for their great unbelief and diſobedience, he tels them, <hi>That even the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and the harlots ſhould go before them into the Kingdom of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31.</note> ſhewing them thereby, that there was ſmall hope for them to be admitted into Heaven, when the moſt notorious ſinners, even Publicans and harlots ſhould take place before them. Thus the name of a Publican, is a name of diſgrace, for they ſeldome (ye ſee) appear in the Book of God, but they come ſhackled together with deſperate perſons, ſomtime with ſinners, ſomtime with harlots, and ſomtime again with heathen or infidels. But <hi>Zacheus</hi> here was not onely a Publican but the chiefe among them, ſo that if the Publicans were ſuch notorious ſinners, then what was he that was the chiefe of the Publicans? And therefore the people had ſo bad an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him, that though they ſaw how earneſtly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee Chriſt, for which they might have thought the better of him, yet they murmured when our Saviour went into his houſe, becauſe he would lodge with ſo ſinfull a man. And yet <hi>Zacheus</hi> though he be the chiefe of the Publicans, and a man reputed to be ſo wicked, yet it is he that is here converted by Chriſt, and brings forth ſuch fruit of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may learn two ſpeciall Leſſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To admire Gods infinite power, who is able to make us new creatures, though we be never ſo wicked, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us again to his own Image. It is ſaid of <hi>Apelles</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent painter, that having made an exquiſite picture it was
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118276:26"/>afterwards by chance ſo ſtrangely defaced, that no man was able to repair the ſame but only <hi>Apelles</hi> himſelfe that made it: And thus man having loſt the Image of God wherein God created him, God only is able to renue the ſame, and by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting us again as it were, into a new mould, to make us the Sons of the living God. If a man ſhould make any curious work, though the matter whereof he made it were either gold or ſilver, yet we would like his workmanſhip, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for it: but if he ſhould take the droſſe thereof, and to ſhew his cunning ſhould make as exquiſite a piece of work as the former, then we would have him in admiration: But God, even of the ſcum, as it were, of the people, even of thoſe that of all other are the vileſt of ſinners, he makes ſingular inſtruments of his own glory, and inables them to bring forth excellent fruits by converting them to grace, as he did here <hi>Zacheus,</hi> which may teach us to admire his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Seeing <hi>Zacheus</hi> is here converted, it may teach us neither to judge raſhly of others, nor to deſpaire of our ſelves, though we have been never ſo hainous ſinners, For who can deſpair of Gods mercy which extends it ſelf even to thoſe that are Publicans? The whole Scripture is written for our inſtruction, and there is not ſo much as one example in the whole Book of God, but a man may make excellent uſe of it, if he will apply it unto himſelfe. For to what end are there ſet down in the Scripture, ſo many examples of Gods wonderfull mercies to grievous ſinners, but that we might learn not to deſpair of mercy, by applying theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples unto our ſelves. When we read of <hi>Zacheus</hi> here, that though he were a Publican and a grievous ſinner, yet as ſoon as he had a deſire to ſee Chriſt and ſought for grace, Chriſt called him unto him, and offered him grace; are we not to make this uſe hereof, that how lewdly ſoever we have lived herecofore, yet if we have a deſire to entertain Chriſt in our hearts, he will offer himſelfe unto us as he did to <hi>Zacheus?</hi> When we read of the Publican in the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> who being truely humbled with the ſight of his ſins, went into the Temple, and prayed unto God, <hi>O God be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> and that he went away juſtified,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118276:26"/>are we not to make this uſe thereof, that if we will humble our ſelves, and acknowledge our ſin, God will likewiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us as he forgave that Publican? In a word vvhen vve read of the young unthrift in the Goſpell, who though he had left his Father and his Countrey, though he had ſpent his patrimony, and that very lewdly, yet after that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and returned to his Father, his Father went out to meet him, and when he ſaw him, he was ſo joyfull for his Sons return, that he never expoſtulated vvhy he had left him, he never demanded hovv he had ſpent his portion, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all his former levvd behaviour, he entertained him as gladly as if he had never offended him; are vve not to make this uſe thereof, that though we have run riot with the Prodigal and lived never ſo levvdly, yet if vve repent and return unto God, he vvill receive us into favour as he did this Prodigall? <hi>For theſe things are written for our inſtruction, that we might apply the ſame to our ſelves, and finde comfort in them.</hi> It vvas a cuſtome among ſome of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that vvhen any man vvas cured of any dangerous diſeaſe, he vvent into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and there he regiſtred his name and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the means whereby he was reſtored to his health, and the reaſon of this cuſtome among them was this, that if any man fell afterwards into the like diſeaſe, he might there finde the means which he was to uſe for his recovery. And thus have Gods Secretaries the pen-men of the Scriptures ſet down in the Book of God many ſeverall examples of ſuch as have been hainous and notorious ſinners, to the intent, that we obſerving both how they fell, and were aftervvards reſtored, finding mercy through their unfeigned repentance, might learn by their examples not to deſpair of mercy.</p>
            <p>And therefore to conclude the firſt point, when ſoever thou art ready to deſpair of Gods mercy through the hainouſneſſe of thy ſins, ſet this example before thine eyes, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that this Publican though he vvere a grievous ſinner, yet as ſoon as ever he ſought for grace, he found grace, and was enabled to perform the works of grace. And thus much for the perſon that gave this gift, <hi>Zacheus</hi> a Publican.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which we are to conſider, is the gift it ſelf, or what he gives, I give ſaith he, the half of my goods.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118276:27"/>He gives of his own and not of other mens goods, and he gives bountifully of his own; for though he be rich, yet he gives the half of his goods.</p>
            <p>Some are forward enough in giving, but they give that which they have no right to give, they give not of their own. Thus when the Devil tempted our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give him all the Kingdoms of the Earth: <hi>All theſe</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>4.5.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>will I give thee if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:</hi> here is a large gift; but <hi>the Earth is the Lords,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David, and all that is therein,</hi> and therefore the Devil had no right to give it, becauſe it was not his own. Some give that which they have unlawfully gotten.</p>
            <p>Thus when <hi>Ahab</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. grew male-content, and would eat no meat, becauſe he could not get <hi>Naboth</hi> to part with his Vineyard: <hi>Jezabell</hi> promiſed him that ſhe would give it him, <hi>Be of good cheere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jezabel</hi> unto <hi>Ahab, I will give thee the Vineyard of Naboth the Jeſrcelite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.7.</note> and then ſhe cauſed <hi>Naboth</hi> to be ſtoned to death, and gave <hi>Ahab</hi> the Vineyard which ſhe had unlawfully gotten. Some give of their own, and that which they have given lawfully, but yet they give ſparingly, as if they were unwilling to give.</p>
            <p>Thus when the <hi>Jewes</hi> did ſell their poſſeſſion, and brought the money unto the Apoſtles to be diſtributed among thoſe that needed, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.35. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira likewiſe ſold their poſſeſſions, as the reſt did; but yet they gave more ſparingly then any of the reſt; for they kept back a part of the price to themſelves.</hi> But we cannot properly be ſaid to give, unleſſe we give of our own; we cannot give of our own, unleſſe we give that which we have lawfully gotten; and though we give of our own, and that which we have gotten lawfully; yet it is not acceptable in the ſight of God, unleſſe we give liberally For howſoever it be a more bleſſed thing to give then to take, as our Saviour ſaid; yet to give that which is none of our own; as the Devill did, is but a meere deluſion: to take from one to give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Jezabell</hi> did, is no better then extortion; and to give ſparingly of our own, as <hi>Ananias</hi> did, argues rather covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and miſery in retaining, then liberality in giving. But <hi>Zacheus</hi> as ye ſee here, gives of his own; <hi>I give,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118276:27"/>Goods,</hi> he gives of his own which he hath lawfully gotten; for look what he had unlawfully gotten from others, he reſtores to the owners in the next words, and that with advantage, and he gives liberally of that which he hath gotten lawfully; for though he be rich, yet he gives the half of his Goods.</p>
            <p>How hard a thing it is for a rich man to part with his Goods, we ſee by an example in the former Chapter, where there comes a rich man unto our Saviour, in the 18. verſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as it ſeemes a full reſolution to do any thing whatſoever, for the obtaining of Heaven. <hi>Good Maſter,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what ought I to do, that I may inherit eternall life?</hi> as if he had ſaid, Good Maſter, if there be any thing that I ought to do, do but teach me what it is, and I will do it: Oh I will do it whatſoever it is. But when Chriſt wills him to ſell all that he had, and to give it to the poor, and he ſhould have Treaſure in Heaven, he went away heavy and diſcontented, as thinking he ſhould have made but a hard bargain; and therefore rather then he would part with his goods, he would part with Chriſt and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. So that here is a great difference between him and <hi>Zacheus.</hi> He, though he was ſpoken to by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to give his goods to the poor, and that with promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Kingdom of Heaven; yet he would not do it: <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> here ſtayes not till he be ſpoken unto, but gives them a way voluntarily, and of his own accord: the one ſhewing what rich men are by nature, the other what they are by grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euripides,</hi> when he brings in any women in his Tragedies, he makes them alwayes bad. <hi>Sophocles</hi> in his Tragedies, makes them alwayes good, whereof when <hi>Sophocles</hi> was asked the reaſon, he made this anſwer: <hi>Euripedes,</hi> ſaith he, repreſents women as they be, I repreſent them as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> in theſe two Chapters, repreſents before our eyes as it were in two ſeverall Pictures, two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent examples of rich men, ſhewing us by the one what rich men are by nature, covetous and miſerable, and by the other what they ought to be, and what they are by grace, franck and bountifull. <hi>If riches increaſe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi>

            <p>There is a Riddle in a <hi>Athenaeus</hi> of two ſiſters,<note place="margin">Athen. Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For firſt, covetouſnes is in labour, and brings forth riches; then riches wax great and bring forth covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the more a man hath, the more he deſires; and though he have never ſo much, yet he is not ſatisfied; but as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they had ſtore of <hi>Manna,</hi> yet they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured aſmuch as when they had none: So though a covetous man have riches in abundance; yet he is no better contented then when he was without them.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is, that covetous men are ſaid to be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, miſerable both in regard of that which they have not, and that which they have, that which they have not makes them diſcontend becauſe they are without it, and as for that which they have, they are no better for it; for though they have what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they want, yet they want indeed whatſoever they have, becauſe they cannot find in their hearts to uſe it. And ſuch for the moſt part are rich men; ſo that this makes much for the commendation of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that though he be rich, yet he is not covetous; but as God hath given him goods, ſo he imploies them to good uſes, and as God hath given him bountifully, ſo he gives bountifully to others. <hi>I give</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the half of my goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, in that he calles them his goods, it confutes the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who hold that all things ought to be common, and that no man hath a right and propriety in any thing; but if this were true, how could <hi>Zacheus</hi> here give of his own? And the Scripture doth every where confute their opinion. We are forbidden by Gods Law to ſteale, but what needed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to inhibit ſtealing if all things were common? for if nothing were more proper to one then another, then no man could properly be ſaid to ſteale,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.17.</note> 
               <hi>leaſt he be weary of thee and hate thee:</hi> but how ſhould any man have a houſe of his own, which might more properly be called his houſe, if all things were common? The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>Charge them which are rich in this World that they be rich in good works, ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, and willing to communicate;</hi> but how ſhould one man be richer then another? or why ſhould we be commanded to give to the poor, if no man had more right then another in any thing? We ſee that the Scripture alloweth of Contracts and bargains in buying and ſelling, as <hi>Abraham</hi> bought a field to bury his dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. And <hi>Lydia</hi> is recorded to have been a ſeller of purple, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. But how ſhould it be lawfull either to buy or to ſell, if all things were common and nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to any man? And we ſee that <hi>Zacheus</hi> here gives of his goods, by all which it is plain, that it muſt needes be an idle conceit of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> in holding that no man hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in any thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the example of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> in that he gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way part of his goods, we may learn this leſſon; that when God doth increaſe our wealth and riches, we are not to keep them private to our ſelves, but to make others partakers of them: like a conduit, which being fed from a Fountain with water, retaines not the water within it felf, but as freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes it on thoſe that want it. <hi>Let every one,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>As he hath received a gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold graces of God.</hi> So that we are but as Stewards to lay out Gods bleſſings, and to diſpoſe them among others. For as God hath given light to the Sun, not only that it ſhould be lightſome in it ſelf, but that it ſhould give light unto other Creatures: &amp; as God cauſeth the rain to fall from Heaven, &amp; to make the earth fruitful, not that it ſhould retain the fruit within it ſelf; but that it ſhould bring forth herbes for the uſe of man: So when God powres down his bleſſings upon us, it is for the good and benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. We ſee in the body, when the ſtomack receives any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118276:29"/>meat or nouriſhment, it imparts the ſame to the reſt of the Members, and ſo muſt we, becauſe we are fellow-Members of the ſame body.</p>
            <p>God gives ſeverall gifts to ſeverall Members. <hi>as to the eye to ſee, to the eare to heare, to the hand to work, to the feet to walk, and to the tongue to ſpeak;</hi> yet they have not theſe gifts to themſelves onely, <hi>but the tongue ſpeakes, the eare heares, the handworks,</hi> and the reſt do imploy their ſeverall faculties for the good and benefit of the whole body. So it muſt be with us, for thoſe gifts which God beſtowes upon us, we muſt not keep them private to our own uſe, but make others alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them, as well as our ſelves. And ſo doth <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who imparts the goods which God hath given him to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others. But let us ſee now to whom he imparts them, <hi>I give,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the half of my goods to the poor:</hi> not to his kindred or friends that love him, nor to the rich that are able to requite him, but he gives his goods to the poor that want them.<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Cato. Majore.</note> 
               <hi>Cato</hi> dividing the prey among his Souldiers which he had got in the Warres, he gave (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) unto all alike, as thinking it better that many ſhould return from the Warres with ſilver, then ſome few with gold, and that all ſhould have ſomething, rather then ſome few ſhould have all, and all the reſt nothing. But God deales otherwiſe in the diſtribution of his gifts, though he gives ſomething to every man, yet he gives not alike unto all men, but to ſome he gives more, and to ſome leſſe, thereby to exerciſe them in ſeverall virtues; that the poor might be moved to pray unto God for the ſupply of their wants; the rich to thankfulneſs to God for his bleſſings; and that the poor might labour and take paines for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; and that the rich might help to relieve them of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity and abundance. And therefore <hi>Zacheus,</hi> knowing that God hath given him riches, not ſo much for himſelf as the good of others, he imparts them here to the poor that want them. Our giving of Almes is compared by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6.) To the ſowing of ſeed. Now ye know when the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ſowes his ſeed, he ſoweth it on the ground which lieth bare and naked, and not not on the ground which hath already Fruit upon it: and thus when we give, we muſt not give unto them that have enough of their own, but to

And thus the poor are commonly waiting at rich mens doors, that when the rich are ſatisfied, the poor might be fed with their leavings. It is worth the obſerving how the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. is left by the Evangeliſt vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all excuſe, and hath nothing left to alledge for himſelf, why he was ſo hard-hearted to poor <hi>Lazarus.</hi> If he ſay, that he was not of ability to relieve the poor, and that he had but ſufficient for himſelf and his family, the Evangeliſt anſwers, <hi>That he was a rich man, that he was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and that he fared ſumptuouſly every day.</hi> If he reply, that though he were wealthy, yet there were ſo many of the poor, that it vvas not for him to relieve them all, the Evangeliſt anſvvers, that there vvas but one. If he reply again, that though there vvas but one, yet he vvas ſuch a one as needed not to have begged, but vvas able enough to have laboured for his living, the Evangeliſt anſwers, That he could not labour, <hi>for he was full of ſores.</hi>

            <p>One writes of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle, that he being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to <hi>Gnodophrus</hi> the King of <hi>India,</hi>

St. <hi>Thomas</hi> having received a great ſumme of mony of the King for the ſame purpoſe, diſtributed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among the poor. The King being therefore incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, cauſed him preſently to be apprehended, and clapt, him in priſon. It happened in the meane time, that the Kings brother fell ſick and died; and afterwards being carried forth to be buried, he revived upon the ſuddain and was brought back againe. And coming to the King, he told him what he had ſeen and heard in Heaven; that he had ſeen a very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pallace which was newly erected, and that he had heard it was built by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> for the King of <hi>India,</hi> but that the King had made himſelf unworthy of it, whereupon St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was ſet at liberty; and the King by hearing the Apoſtles doctrine, was ſoone after converted to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory it ſelf may well be but a ſiction; but this is moſt certaine, that whatſoever we give to the poore upon earth, is rewarded in Heaven. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> (will Christ ſay at the day of Judgement, <hi>Math.</hi> 25<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it may be demanded, what kind of poor are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? For anſwer whereof, we muſt diſtinguiſh of ſuch as are poor. For ſome become poor and fall into want through their own fault, and that eſpecially two wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by unthriftineſs, as by gaming, drinking, keeping ill Company, and unneceſſary miſpending that portion of goods which God hath given them. Theſe, howſoever the World accounts them good-fellowes; yet God reputes them no better then the theeves, and no doubt without their repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, they will be arraigned and condemned for theeves, at the day of judgement. For theſe by their unthriftineſs do waſte their Eſtate, miſpend their time, looſe their good name, impoveriſh themſelves, and undoe their Children: and ſo by this meanes, do themſelves more harme, then any theeſe could do, that ſhould meete them in the high way, and take their purſe away from them.</p>
            <p>Theſe, becauſe they fall into want through their own fault, are the leſſe to be pittied. And as theſe become poor through their own unthriftineſs; ſo others by idleneſs &amp; want of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their particular Callings. For want is alwayes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon idleneſs; and where idleneſs goes before, want fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes after. And therefore <hi>Solemon</hi> ſpeakes of an idle man in this manner.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.30.31.</note> 
               <hi>I paſſed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by the field of the ſlothfull man, and loe it was all over growen with thornes, and nettles had cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the face thereof, and the ſtone wall thereof was broken down:</hi> and then he ſheweth what his end was, that poverty came upon him like an armed man. For he that will be idle muſt needes be poor. And this is the cauſe, that there are ſuch ſwarmes of beggers in every place, who being well able to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for their livings, chooſe rather to live upon other mers labours, and had rather live by begging then take any paines to get their living. Theſe are wicked Generation, having this curſe of God upon them to be vagabonds upon the earth, and to wander up and down from place to place, becauſe they will not yield to the Ordinance of God: In the ſweat of thy browes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118276:31"/>thou ſhalt eat thy bread. The faithleſs Steward,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.3</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 16. though he could not digge, yet he was aſhmed to begge; but theſe are more faithleſs in their Callings, who are not aſhamed to begge, when they are able to digge or to take any other paines to get their livings. Such the Apoſtle will not have to be relieved, <hi>He that will not labour let him not eat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10.</note> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. For by giving unto theſe, we both maintain them in their idleneſſe, and we diſable our ſelves from giving to thoſe, that are not able to labour for their livings. And as theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor through their own fault: So ſome become poor and fall into want through the hand of God; As ſuch as looſe their goods by fire, by theeves, or any other meanes which they could not avoid: or ſuch as fall into decay through any infirmity; as by lameneſs, blindneſs, ſickneſs or age, and ſo are not able to labour for their livings: or ſuch as have a great charge of Children, ſo that howſoever they be able to labour, yet their la our will not maintain both themſelves and them. Theſe and the like are the poor whom the Scripture will have us to relieve, and to ſuch no doubt <hi>Zacheus</hi> here gave. And thus much likewiſe for the perſons to whom he gave his goods.</p>
            <p>The laſt point to be conſidered, is the time when he gave them his goods <hi>I give,</hi> ſaith he, he gives them preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay, he gives them not upon his Death-bed, or when he lyeth a dying; but he gives them now in the time of his health, while he might have ſtill injoyed them.</p>
            <p>As there are many that deferre their repentance to the end of their life, ſo there are many that deferre their liberality and almes-deedes to the poor, till the day of their death. But as the ones over-late repentance is ſeldome acceptable, becauſe they do but then leave their ſins, when they can ſin no more: ſo the others late giving to the poor, is ſeldome available, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do but then give away their goods, when they can keep them no longer. And therefore it is the juſt judgement of God upon many, who having attained great wealth and riches, and doing no good therewith in their lives, are ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by death upon the ſuddain, that they have no time to diſpoſe of their goods at their ends, which may teach us to do it in our life-time our ſelves, and not to leave it to be done by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118276:32"/>others after us. All Gods Commandements are given ye know in the ſecond perſon to every one, that every one might take them as ſpoken to himſelf, and ſo might performe them in his own perſon: We read of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, that upon a time as he was going to warre, a poor Widow met him, and taking hold of his horſe, deſired him before he went to do her juſtice. The Emperour willed her to reſt content for a time, and he would not faile to do her juſtice when he returned home. Oh ſaith the Widow, but how if it happen that you never return? why then ſaith the Emperour I will leave it to my Succeſſor, and he ſhall do thee juſtice in my roome: your Succeſſor (ſaith ſhe) and why not you your ſelf? you are bound to do good in your own perſon, and what is that to you if another diſcharge that which is your duty? <hi>num te libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabit aliena juſtitia?</hi> will another mans juſtice excuſe you? The Emperour was ſo moved with this ſpeech of hers, that before he went any further, he in his own perſon did her ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And ſo may we ſay unto thoſe, who put off thoſe duties, which themſelves ought to do, to be done by others; what is that to you if another diſcharge that which is your duty? or if you leave it to your Heire to relieve the poor? you are bound to relieve them as well as he; and if he ſhould leave it to his Heire as you have done, what ſhall become of the poor in the mean time? <hi>Zacheus</hi> did not thus, but making his hands his executors, and his eyes his overſeers; he gave his goods to the poor himſelf, and did not leave it to be done by others. And therefore if <hi>Zacheus,</hi> as ſoone as he was converted, was ſo fruitfull in good works, it may be a ſhame for us, if we that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtianity ſo long, do come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him in the works of mercy.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is mention in my text of gaining and loſing, and a compariſon between them: gaining the World, the whole world, a great gaine; loſing the Soul, a mans own ſoul, a farre greater loſſe: For our Saviour, comparing them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewes that howſoever the gaine be great, yet the loſſe is greater; and that he that ſhould purchaſe the whole World with the loſſe of his own ſoul, he ſhould not gaine ſo much on the one ſide, as he ſhould loſe on the other; <hi>For what</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a man profited, if he ſhall gaine the whole World and loſe his own ſoul?</hi>

            <p>Firſt therefore, I will ſhew you what this gaine is. Secondly, what this loſſe is. And then having compared them both together, I will come to ſome Uſe to be made of it.</p>

               </gap>? This is that which the moſt ſo affect, that they can never find any arietie in it; but the more they have the more they deſire, and the greater the gaine the more it affects them. But
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118276:33"/>here you ſee is the gaining of the whole World, a whole world of gaine; that if a man will part with his ſoul for any thing, he can hardly part with it upon a better bargaine.</p>

            <p>A Kingdom can hardly be valued at too high a rate. For if we conſider the ſtate of a King, there is ſcarce any thing that may ſeem to make a man happy, that can be wanting unto him. His word, for the moſt part, is a ſufficient warrant for the effecting of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and his intreatie a moſt forcible kind of command for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his deſire: ſo that if he would have any thing, he may have what he likes, and no man deny him; if he would do any thing, he may do what he pleaſe, and no man oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>If therefore a King be ſo mighty, how mighty ſhould the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World be? If he hath ſuch command that hath but a Kingdom, What command ſhould he have, that ſhould have the whole World under his Dominion?</p>

            <p>A <hi>King,</hi> howſoever his power be great, yet he hath his equals in other Countries; and though his command reach very far, yet it reacheth no farther then his own Dominions: But he that were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118276:33"/>Monarch of the whole World; command where he would and he ſhould be obeyed; for all the Princes of the earth ſhould be his Subjects.</p>
            <p>A <hi>King,</hi> though he may have whatſoever his Kingdom affords; yet every Kingdom affords not every thing, and thoſe things do commonly moſt affect us, which other Countries do yield and are not to-be had in our own: But he that were Monarch of the whole World, whatſoever any Kingdom in the World could afford, he ſhould be ſure to have it, and happy were he that ſhould firſt preſent it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>King,</hi> though he may greatly advance his favorites; yet he hath but one Kingdom for himſelf and them, and if with <hi>Herod</hi> he ſhould promiſe unto one the half of his Kingdom,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 6.23.</note> and after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as much to another, were he taken at his word he might leave himſelf nothing: But he that were Monarch of the whole World, he ſhould have ſeverall Kingdoms for his ſeverall favorites'; and yet leave himſelf more when he had inriched them all, then ever <hi>Alexander</hi> had after all his conqueſts.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that to perſwade the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to follow him in the warres, he made them this promiſe; They, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi>

This was a great advancement of his followers: But he that were Monarch of the whole World, where <hi>King Cyrus</hi> left there might he begin, They who were his favourites and Lords of Towns, he might make them Princes, and give them Kingdoms; if they were Kings he might make them Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and if this were not enough he might double their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. For a Kingdom in compariſon of the whole World, is no more then a town in compariſon of a Kingdom; then what would not a man do for ſo great a gaine?</p>
            <p>And therefore the Devill, when he tempted our Saviour in the fourth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> knowing that there is not any more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument, to perſwade a man to any thing then the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World, like a cunning Orator, he reſerved this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the laſt of all, and when he had ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World and the glory of them, and had

For he that will not ſtoop to ſo faire a lure, he that will not be moved with ſo great a gain, he will be moved with nothing.</p>
            <p>But now howſoever this gain be great, yet withall it hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inconveniences, which do leſſen and diminiſh the value of it, And therefore as he that would purchaſe a houſe, he will not only know what commodities it hath, but he will likewiſe be informed of the inconveniences of it. So having heard of the profits and pleaſures and preferments of the world, we are further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the diſcommodities of it. And they eſpecially are theſe three.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That whatſoever the world can afford us, yet it is but ſhort and of ſmall continuance. For were a man Monarch of the whole World, and had he all that his heart could deſire, yet when he dieth, he muſt leave all that he hath, and all that he hath can neither deferre the comming of death, nor make him ſecure that he ſhall enjoy them an hour: and as he brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with him when he came into the world, ſo he muſt leave all behind him when he leaves the world.<note place="margin">Fulgoſ. lib. <hi>7.</hi> cap: <hi>2</hi>|</note> And therefore <hi>Saladine</hi> a great and victorious Prince in his dayes, he gave command when he lay upon his death-bed, that at his Funerall his winding-ſheet ſhould be carried on a ſpear before him with this proclamation, That of all the victories which <hi>Saladine</hi> had gotten, this winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet was even all that he carried him. For when a man dies he muſt leave all; and though he have never ſo much, yet he may die before the day ends.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118276:34"/>Army, and ſubdue <hi>Sicily.</hi> He asked him again, what he would do if that he vanquiſht them? the King anſwered, that then he would go into <hi>Africa,</hi> and bring all <hi>Africa</hi> under his dominion. But (ſaith <hi>Cyneas</hi>) if you ſubdue all <hi>Africa,</hi> what then will you do? why then, ſaith the King, we will live merrily together, and ſpend the reſt of our dayes in delight and pleaſure. Alas (ſaith <hi>Cyneas</hi>) if that be all, what need all this labour? you have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom already, &amp; you may live as contentedly with that which you have, as if you had more. <hi>Cui quod ſatis eſt non ſufficit, nihil ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> He that is not content with that which is ſufficient, will never be content though he have more then ſufficient. So that this is another inconvenience of the world, that the pleaſures, profits and preferments thereof, can never afford any true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third and laſt inconvenience is this, which indeed is the greateſt of all the reſt, that the more a man loves and affects the world, the leſſe he is affected with the love of God. Therefore our Saviour, to ſhew that the love of God and the love of the world cannot ſtand together, but that he that doth cleave to the one, muſt of neceſſity leave the other, he makes a flat oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>Ye cannot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſerve both God and Mammon.</hi> We read of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> the School-man, that when he came upon a time to Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third of that name, the Pope had then great ſtore of ſilver and gold lying before him; you ſee, ſaith the Pope to <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> I cannot ſay, as ſometime my Predeceſſour Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Argentum &amp; aurum non habeo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 3.6.</note> Silver and gold have I none. True holy Father, anſwer'd <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> but therefore you cannot adde as he did, <hi>Surge &amp; ambula,</hi> Ariſe and walk: To note unto him, that the more he was carefull for the goods of the world, the leſſe able he was to perforn ſuch good works, as the Apoſtles did. For the love of the world, and the love of God, as I ſaid before, cannot ſtand together. We ſee then, what it is to gain the world, and withall, the diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inconveniences of it.</p>
            <p>Now again, though it be great, yet it may too dearly be bought, as when <hi>Gehazi</hi> gained two talents of ſilver, but a leproſie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.</note> If a man ſhould angle with a golden hook, all the fiſh which he took would not make him amends for the loſſe of it: and it is not wiſdome to venture any thing where a man may loſe more then he can gain by the bargain. For gain is not ſo welcome and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118276:35"/>acceptable to any man, as loſſe is grievous, eſpecially where the gain will not countervail the loſſe. But here indeed is a very great gain, the gaining of the world, but withall a loſſe that is far greater, the loſſe of all loſſes, the loſſe of the ſoul. Let us ſee therefore now what this loſſe is.</p>
            <p>The ſoule, as the more excellent part of man, is put here by a figure for the whole man, the ſoule for both body and ſoule to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And therefore that which is here called by Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> the loſing of the ſoul, is called by Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in his 9th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> the loſing of a mans ſelfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9.25.</note> 
               <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a man advantaged, if he gain the Whole world, and loſe himſelfe?</hi> So that the loſing of the ſoul, is the loſing of a mans ſelfe both body and ſoule. The greatneſſe of which loſſe will the better appear, if we take a view of a double miſery which the ſoul which is loſt is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo: the one in regard of the felicity it loſes, the joyes of heaven, the other in regard of the torments if ſuſters, the pains of hell; both implied in thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Depart from me ye c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rſed into everlaſting ſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, The ſoul which is loſt, is for ever baniſht from the ſight of God, and therefore being baniſht from his ſight and preſence, is withall excluded from all joy and happineſſe. For the ſight of God, as the Scripture tels us, is that which hereafter ſhall make us bleſſed.<note place="margin">

When Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw our Saviour transfigured on the Mount with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> he was ſo affected with the ſight, that he cried out to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Maſter, it is good for us to be here, if thou wilt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moſes, and one for Elias.</hi> If he were ſo affected with the glorious preſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> how ſhall they be affected, that ſhall for ever enjoy the glorious company of all the Patriarchs.

               <hi>neither hath it entred into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>David</hi> cries out with admiration,<note place="margin">

               <hi>ó quàm magna eſt bonitas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſſe which thou haſt laid up for them that feare thee! how great,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is thy goodneſs!</hi> he knew it was great, but how great he knew not. And therefore St. <hi>Paul, calls it the glory that ſhall be revealed:</hi> it ſhal be revealed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</note> but as yet it is not. For we ſhal not know it, until we injoy it, &amp; when we enjoy it, we ſhal find it far greater then ever we expected. That as the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sheba,</hi> when ſhe had ſeen the wiſdom and glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhe confeſt that ſhe believed not the report thereof untill ſhe had ſeen it; and when ſhe had ſeen it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.7.</note> that ſhe found that the half had not been reported. So then we ſhall ſay, many excellent things have been ſpoken of thee, thou City of God, which at firſt when we heard, the report was ſo great that we could hardly believe it; but now we ſee that we heard not then of the half of thy glory, and though the happineſs which we expected was very great, yet we find it far greater then ever we expected. Now the more unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this happineſs is, and the greater theſe joyes, the more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is the ſoule that may not injoy them, and the more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118276:36"/>is the loſſe of the ſoule that is baniſht from them. When <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was baniſhed from the <hi>Kings</hi> Court, and might not be admitted into the preſence of <hi>David,</hi> it was ſuch a vexation and torment unto him, that he wiſhed rather to die if he had deſerved it, then to live as he did for a time in baniſhment.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32.</note> Then how wretched and miſerable is their condition, that ſhall for ever be baniſhed from the preſence of God and the joyes of Heaven? And yet this is not all, for though the loſſe of their joyes were miſery enough, though there were no more, yet that which remaines is farre more intolerable. For they ſhall not onely loſe all theſe joyes; but withall, they ſhall ſuffer extream torments. The torments they ſhall ſuffer is Hell-fire, the manner, in every part and Member, and the time or continuance even for ever and ever. The fire which we have ye know, is ſo terrible, that a man would not for any thing hold his arme therein, but for the ſpace of an houre. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fire which we have here be ſo terrible, which God hath ordained for mans uſe and comfort; how terrible is that fire, which God hath onely prepared for a torment. Here whatſoever a man ſuffers, yet he is not tormented in every Member, but ſome ſuffer in one part, and ſome in another; but there every part ſhall be tormented and all together. Here whatſoever a man ſuffers, yet it continues not long, and the paine, the more violent it is, the leſſe it continues, but there though the paines be never ſo intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet they muſt ſuffer them for ever. If it were but for ſo many thouſands of years, as there were ſeverall houres from the Creation of the world to the day of judgement, yet they might comfort themſelves in this, that there would come a time when their torments ſhould ceaſe; but what comfort can they have, when they conſider with themſelves, that when they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued never ſo long therein, yet ſtill they are as farre from the end thereof, as they were at the beginning.</p>
            <p>But here by the way, two queſtions may be propounded.</p>
            <p>Firſt. How it is poſſible, that the bodies of the wicked ſhould continue for ever in Hell-fire, and not be conſumed?</p>
            <p>And Secondly, how it can ſtand with the juſtice of God, to puniſh the temporall ſinnes of men with eternall puniſhment?</p>
            <p>For the firſt we ſee, that the fire which we have, will conſume and burn to nothing in a very ſhort time, even thoſe things which are more durable then our bodies are: and therefore how ſhould the bodies of the wicked lie burning for ever in Hell-fire, and not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118276:36"/>be conſumed. But if we conſider Gods infinit power, we need not to make any doubt hereof, becauſe he that hath ſaid it, is able to perform it. For God that was able to bring this to paſſe for the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that their Cloathes waxt not old,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.5.</note> nor their ſhoes wore out, while they lived in the deſert forty years together. God that was able to preſerve the three Children in the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27.</note> ſo that the fire had no power to hurt their bodies: and God that was able to preſerve the Buſh in the third of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that though the fire did burn it, yet it did not conſume it: he is able like wiſe to bring this to paſſe; that the bodies of the wicked, though they lie burning for ever in Hell-fire, yet they ſhall never be conſumed.</p>
            <p>But the ſecond queſtion is ſomewhat more difficult, how it can ſtand with the juſtice of God, to puniſh the temporall ſinnes of men with eternall puniſhment? For the puniſhment muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the fault, it being againſt the rule of juſtice, to inflict any puniſhment that is greater then the offence.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſee, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.7.</note> That God did proportion the puniſhment of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the meaſure of her ſinne, how much ſhe hath exalted her ſelf and lived deliciouſly, <hi>give her,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>ſo much torment and ſorrow.</hi> But the pleaſure of ſinne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</note> as the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11. <hi>is but for a ſeaſon;</hi> and therefore ſeeing the ſinnes of the wicked are but temporall, how can it ſtand with the juſtice of God, that their puniſhment is eternall?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore we are to know, that ſinne, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and paſt in a moment, yet as it is a treſpaſſe againſt God that is infinite, ſo it deſerves an infinite puniſhment. <hi>Tanto majus eſt peccatum, quanto major in quem peccatur.</hi> Every ſinne is by ſo much the greater, and ſo deſerves the greater puniſhment, as the perſon is the greater againſt whom it is committed.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould diſhonour and revile his Father, he deſerves ye know, a farre greater puniſhment, then he that ſhould diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and revile his Neighbour. If a man ſhould ſtrike a publick <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> he deſerves a greater puniſhment to be inflicted upon him, then he ſhould, if he ſtruck but a private perſon; but every ſinne is committed againſt God, and therefore deſerves eternall puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though the wicked do but ſinne for a time, yet they have a perpetuall deſire to ſinne, and ſhould they live never ſo long in this World, they would continue in ſinne, For like as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118276:37"/>Gameſters, that delight in nothing ſo much as in gaming, they will uſually play as long as they can ſee, and ſtill have a deſire to play longer, but that the night comes upon them and compells them to give over: So it is with ſinners, they take their pleaſure and delight in their ſinnes, through the whole courſe of their life, and ſo would continually go on in their ſinnes, but that they are prevented and cut oft by death. <hi>Voluiſſent</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) <hi>ſine fine vivere, ut ſine fine poſsent in iniquitatibus permanere.</hi> they would have lived in this World for ever, that they might have continued in their ſinnes for ever; and therefore as they would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſinned, ſo they juſtly deſerve to be eternally puniſhed. And thus we have heard What it is to loſe the ſoule, and the miſery which the ſoule which is loſt is to undergoe, both in regard of the felicity it ſhall loſe, and the torments it ſhall ſuffer.</p>
            <p>What compariſon is there then, between the gaining of the World, and the loſing of the ſoule? the gaining of the World with ſome temporall pleaſures, and the loſing of the ſoule with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſs? the gaining of the World, whereby we are freed from ſome worldly miſeries, and the loſing of the ſoule, whereby we are ſubject to everlaſting torments? the gaining of the World, whereby for a time we may advance our friends, and the loſing of the ſoule, whereby for ever we undo our ſelves? All other loſſes whether of body or goods a man may well bear, but the loſſe of the ſoule, of all other loſſes is the moſt intolerable: whatſoever a man loſeth beſides his ſoule, yet he loſeth that which was given him but for a time, and which at one time or other he muſt have forgone; but loſing his ſoule, he loſeth that which he might have kept for ever. Whatſoever a man loſeth beſides his ſoule, yet he may recover it again If he loſe his Children as <hi>Job</hi> did,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 1.19.</note> yet he may have more: if he loſe his friends as <hi>David</hi> did, yet he may find better:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.31.</note> if he loſe his Kingdom as <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> did, yet he may recover it again or get another; but loſing his ſoule, he loſeth that which he can never recover. Whatſoever a man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth beſides his ſoule, yet he hath ſomething left him. If he loſe his goods, yet he may have a good name; if he loſe his good name, yet he may have his liberty; if he loſe his liberty, yet his life may be left him; and if he loſe his life, yet his ſoule is remaining; but loſing his ſoule, he hath no more to loſe, but loſeth all at once; his life, liberty, goods, good-name, even all that he hath, and his ſoule beſides.</p>

A ſimilitude which is uſual and ordinary in the Scripture, wherein we are more often reſembled to graſſe, and to the flower of the field, then to any thing elſe.

            <p>And not to alledge any more places, <hi>David</hi> ſaith here, <hi>that mans dayes are as graſſe, and as the flower of the field, ſo he flowriſhes.</hi> Which ſimilitude, the Scripture the more often uſeth, as being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118276:39"/>from thoſe things which are daily in our way and continually before us, that whereas we are ſo prone to forget our mortality, the very graſſe and flowers of the field might be our remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; that if wee ſtirre but out of doores, and ſee how ſoone they come up and how ſoon they are gone; they might put us in mind of our own condition.</p>
            <p>In handling of which ſimilitude, I will firſt ſhew you briefly, how man is very fitly reſembled to the graſſe, and to the floures of the field, and then come to ſome Uſes that may be made of it.</p>
            <p>Man therefore is fitly reſembled to theſe in three reſpects. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their like beginning, in reſpect of their like progreſſe and continuance, and in reſpect of their like ending.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, In reſpect of the like beginning and Originall of them. Ye know that the graſſe and the flowers of the field do ſpring out of the earth, the earth as their mother, doth bear them in her womb and bring them forth. For God ſaid at the Creation, <hi>Let the earth bring forth fruite,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.11.</note> and the hearb yielding ſeed;</hi> and ſo thorough that powerfull word of God, the earth ſtill brings them forth. Though there be great difference between flowers, that ſome are more beautifull then others are, and make a fairer ſhew, ſome have a more fragrant ſent then others, and ſome more variety of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full colours, yet they are all alike in this, that the earth is the place from whence they ſprang &amp; had their beginning. And in this regard man is reſembled very fitly to <hi>graſſe and to the floures of the field.</hi> For he had likewiſe his beginning from the earth, as the matter whereof he was firſt made.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Job</hi> 4.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, formed man of the duſt of the ground.</hi> Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledged, that he was but duſt and aſhes. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that we <hi>dwell in houſes of clay, and that our foundation is in the duſt:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls our bodies <hi>earthen veſſels.</hi> And this is the condition not of ſome, but of every one of us. Though ſome do greatly differ from others, and make a fairer ſhew then others do, either in regard of their birth and parentage, or for their place and office, or for their wealth and riches, their beauty, wiſdome wit or eloquence; yet they are all alike in this, that they had their originall from the earth and were made thereof. And ſo for their beginning all men are but as <hi>graſſe, and the flowers of the field</hi> which ſpring from the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, They are alike fortheir progreſſe and continuance. Ye know that the graſſe and the flowers of the field are very tender
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118276:39"/>when they firſt ſpring up; and when they are come to their full growth and ſtrength, that they have taken deeper root and have a ſtronger ſtalk; yet ſtill they are ſo weak, that the leaſt blaſt of wind will ſhake them up and down, and any little force will put them up, and cauſe them to wither before their time: or if they continue their full time; yet their time is very ſhort, they flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh but a while, and preſently wither. <hi>In the morning</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.6.</note> (ſpeaking of the graſſe in the 90. <hi>Pſalme</hi>) <hi>it is green and growth up; but in the evening it is cut down, dried up and withered,</hi> And in this reſpect, man is likewiſe very fitly reſembled to the graſſe and flowers of the field. He is weak and tender while he is growing up, and when he is come to his full growth and ſtrength; yet he is not ſo ſtrong, but the leaſt fit of an Ague you know will ſhake him, and any little ſickneſſe will ſoon pull him down, and bring him to his end before his time.</p>
            <p>And though he eſcape all ſickneſſe and diſeaſes, and all other caſualties; yet his time is but ſhort, age will come upon him before it be long and bring him to his end. And ſo in regard of his progreſſe and continuance, he is well likened to the graſſe and flowers of the field.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly they are alike in regard of their end. Ye know when the graſſe and the flowers of the field do die and wither, they loſe their beauty, they loſe their colour, they loſe their ſent, and they loſe their name, and at laſt are ſo dryed to duſt and powder, that they are all alike, and cannot be known what flowers they were. In our Gardens and Fields we ſee many flowers, which while they are growing do greatly differ, inſomuch that we can very eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, and tell what every one of them are: but after they are withered and dryed to duſt, they are alſo like, that we cannot diſtinguiſh the one from the other. And thus it is with us, as ſoone as men die they loſe their beauty, they loſe their pomp, they loſe their bravery, they loſe their very names, and in the end are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to duſt and aſhes, and have nothing left them whereby they may be known. For the time that men are living there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among thent; ſome are of high place, ſome of mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſome wiſe, ſome ſimple; ſome rich, ſome poore; ſome of one complextion, ſome of another; but being laid in their graves and conſumed to aſhes, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> cannot be known from <hi>Therſites;</hi> the rich glutton in the Goſpel, cannot be known from <hi>Lazarus;</hi> but all are ſo like that we can ſee no difference. <hi>Reſpice ſepulchra,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:118276:40"/>ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, et diſcerne ſi potes Jrum a Rege, fortem a debili, pulorum a deformi,</hi> Look into mens Sepulchers, and diſtinguiſh if thou canſt between the King and the beggar; the ſtrong and the weak; the faire and the deformed.</p>
            <p>Therefore we read of <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philoſopher, that when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great as he was paſſing by, ſaw him looking very wiſly into Tombs and Sepulchres, and demanded of him what he was looking for, <hi>Diogenes</hi> anſwered, That he was looking for the bones of King <hi>Philip, Alexanders</hi> Father, who had been the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and that he could not diſtinguiſh them from other mens bones, nor finde any difference: To note unto <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> that even he, notwithſtanding all his pomp and bravery, after all his conqueſts, muſt in the end be laid in the duſt, and then there would be no difference between him and others. We ſee then briefly, how man is like the graſſe and the flowers of the field; and wherein this reſemblance between them conſiſts, That they are like for their beginning, like for their continuance, and like for their end. But that which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> here ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intends, is the ſecond of theſe, that they are like for their ſhort continuance. For he ſaith, <hi>That the dayes of man are as graſſe,</hi> not reckoning our life-time by years, or by moneths, but only by dayes, to ſignifie how ſoon our life paſſes, even as the graſſe, and the flower, which doth not continue from one year to another, but as it comes up ſoon, ſo it ſoon withers And he ſaith, <hi>That man ſlouriſheth as the flower of the field. Sient ſlos agri, non horti,</hi> As the flower of the field, not as the flower of the garden: for garden-flowers ye know are more carefully lookt to, the Gardiner keeps them ſtanding as long as he can, becauſe they make a faire ſhew, and are a grace to the gardens; but for field-flowers, they are ſubject, ye know, to many more dangers, they lie open to paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that pull them up, and to the beaſts, that either crop them, or tread them under foot, and if they eſcape all dangers, yet the time they flouriſh is very ſhort; they come up later then the graſſe, and yet ſtand no longer, for when the graſſe is cut down, they are cut down together.</p>
            <p>Here then in that we are reſembled to <hi>graſſe, and the flowers of the field,</hi> we may obſerve from hence two things, The certainty of our death, and the ſhortneſſe of our life.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The certainty of our death, That we ſhall as certainly die, as we are ſure that the graſſe and flowers of the field ſhall fade
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118276:40"/>and wither. Death indeed is uncertain in ſome reſpects, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the time, in reſpect of the place, and in reſpect of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ner thereof; becauſe we do not know, either when or where or how we ſhall die. Death is uncertain in regard of the time, for we do not know when death will arreſt us, whether by day or by night, whether in the morning, at noon, or in the evering, whether at the cock-crowing or in the dawning. For when we lie down, we do not know whether we ſhall riſe again, and when we are riſen, we do not know whether we ſhall lie down again. Death is uncertain in regard of the place, becauſe we do not know where death will arreſt us, whether when we are in company, or when we are alone, whether in the Field, or in the Town, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or at home; for when we go forth we do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall return again, and when we are returned, we do not know whether we ſhall go forth again. And death is uncertain in regard of the manner, becauſe we do not know how death will arreſt us, whether we ſhall die a naturall or a violent death, whether a painfull or an eaſie death, whether a lingring or a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death. In theſe reſpects death is uncertain, yet nothing again more certain then death. For though we know not as I ſaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where, or when, or how we ſhall die, yet we know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that either here or elſe-where, either ſooner or later, either by one means or other, we are ſure to die. Therefore <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this queſtion, <hi>What man is he that lives and ſhall not ſee death?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.48.</note> becauſe death is common to all men, and no man by his greatneſſe, ſtrength, or wiſdome, or any other means can avoid the ſame. And this the <hi>Heathen</hi> knew very well, and therefore though they worſhipt the Sunne, the Moon, and all the Hoſt of heaven, though they offered ſacrifice to ſtocks, to ſtones, to men, to divels, and to all manner of creatures, whom they worſhipt as Gods; yet among all their ſacrifices, there was never any that offeted ſacrifice to death, as knowing that death will never be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and therefore that their ſacrifices ſhould have been to no purpoſe, <hi>Contra omnia aliquid inveniri poteſt, contra mortem ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil.</hi> One remedy or other may be found againſt every thing, but no remedy can poſſibly be found againſt death, <hi>Galen, Hipocrates,</hi> and other skilfull Phyſicians have found out many remedies againſt the moſt diſeaſes, and have preſcribed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rules how to preſerve our health, and to keep us from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but how to preſerve and keep us from death, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118276:41"/>any that could invent any remedy. And though <hi>Paracelſus</hi> had ſuch conſidence in his knowledge, that he profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe able, to keep a man by phyſick in ſo perfect a temperature, that he ſhould never die of any diſeaſe whatfoever, yet he could not preſcribe any phyſick againſt death. For though we diet our bodies, and uſe all preſervatives to keep us from ſiokneſſe, and though we live all our life time without any diſeaſe, yet either ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnality or age will bring us to our graves. Therefore the grave is called by <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 30.23.</note> 
               <hi>the houſe appointed for all the living, I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>that thou Wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe appointed for all the living:</hi> it is appointed, and therefore cannot be avoided, it is appointed for all the living, and therefore none are exempted, but all that live upon the face of the earth are ſubject unto it. In ſeverall Kingdoms there are ſeverall Lawes, whereunto they are not bound in other Kingdoms. Now in the whole world there are three Kingdoms, where the Laws concerning death are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. In heaven they have a Law, that they ſhall live for ever, and never die.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17.</note> Therefore heaven is called by the name of life, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>thou wilt enter into life,</hi> (that is into heaven) <hi>keep the Commandements.</hi> And heaven is called <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>the land of the living, I ſhould</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>have utterly fainted, but that I believe verily to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the living:</hi> that is, in heaven, <hi>for there they live eternally, and never die.</hi> In hell there is a quite contrary law, <hi>that they die eternally.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>They lie in hell like ſheep, and death gnawes upon them, becauſe there they ſuffer the ſecond death, which is everlaſting.</hi> And here upon earth, there is a third law between them both,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27.</note> 
               <hi>That every one living ſhall once ſuffer death.</hi> Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>It is appointed unto all men that they ſhall once dye:</hi> not live here for ever, as they do in heaven, nor die for ever as they do in hell, but once they muſt die: and this is a law which all that live on the face of the earth are ſubject unto. God hath given great priviledges to many of his ſervants, and hath miraculouſly preſerved them from many dangers;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exed.</hi> 34.28. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.29. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12.13.</note> ſome he hath preſerved without any nouriſhment for many weeks together, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elius;</hi> ſome he hath preſerved in the midſt of fire, as the <hi>three children in the furnace:</hi> ſome he hath inabled to walk upon the waters, as <hi>Peter</hi> did; ſome he hath inabled to ſtay the courſe of the Sun, as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did: but to ſtay and hinder the courſe of death, and to free men from the ſame, this is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118276:41"/>which God never gave to any of his ſervants. Therefore even they that lived before the deluge, though ſome of them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeven hundred years, ſome eight hundred, ſome nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and upwards, yet they died in the end: nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying more and more in them, till it were quite ſpent, as a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle being lighted, waſtes by little and little, till it quite goes out.</p>
            <p>Seeing then it is certain that we ſhall die, this may therefore teach us to fit and prepare our ſelves againſt the coming of death, by frequent meditation and remembrance thereof. The oftner a man bethinks him of death, the better he will be prepared for it: as a man that foreſees and expects a ſtorm, he will provide himſelf the better againſt it come. And herein the <hi>Heathen</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be patterns unto us, who though they knew not God, nor the puniſhment of ſin in the world to come, yet knowing they ſhould die, they uſed many ſtrange and memorable deviſes, to put them in mind of their mortality. <hi>Ortelius</hi> writes of a Countrey in the World, where the people do uſe the bones of dead men in ſtead of their coin; which being continually before their eyes, they cannot but continually remember their ends. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes of <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> That alwayes when he made any ſumptuous feaſt, among the reſt of his diſhes, the skull and bones of a dead man were brought in a platter, and ſet before him, and one was appointed to ſay thus unto him,<note place="margin">Plutarch in Conviv. Sept. Sapientum.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, O King, and conſider with thy ſelfe this preſident of death, that he whoſe skull and bones thou now ſeeſt, was once like thy ſelfe, and the time will come when thou ſhalt be like unto him, and thy skull and bones ſhall be brought hereafter to the Kings table, as now his are to thint. Iſodore</hi> writes. That it was a cuſtome in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> that alwayes at the time of the <hi>Emperours Coronation,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Solemnities this was one, A free, Maſon preſented the Emperour with divers ſorts of marble, and asked him of which of them he ſhould make his Tomb, that ſo he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, even then when he was in the height of his glory, that he was but mortall. <hi>Dion</hi> writes of <hi>Severus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, That while he lived he cauſed his Hearſe to be made, and was often wont to go in into it, adding theſe words, <hi>Thou O Herſe, as ſmall as thou art, muſt contain him, whom now the whole world is ſearce able to contain.</hi> If theſe who were <hi>Heathen</hi> were ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their ends, what ſhould we that are <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> We know that God hath made the end of our life, the manner of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118276:42"/>our death, and the place thereof to be unknown and uncertain, that we might alwayes have it in expectation. So ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Latet ultimus dies ut obſerventur omnes dies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſtine Hom. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> The laſt day of our lives is hidden from us, that that day might be expected all the dayes of our lives. And indeed the reaſon why we are not prepared for the comming of death, is becauſe we ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of dying; for who of us almoſt have any thought thereof, till either ſickneſſe, or age, the two Serjeants of death do come to arreſt us? or if at any other time we bethink us thereof, it is only then when we hear the Bell to ring out for any, or when we ſee ſome of our neighbours to lie upon their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and paſt recovery. Then it may be we think of our ends, and that it is high time for us to prepare our ſelves for death, that we may be in a readineſſe againſt God ſhall call us. But theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are but for a fit, and they preſently vaniſh. I have ſeen ſomtimes, when a Fowler coming to a Tree where there were ſtore of birds, and hath killed any one of them, all the reſt have immediately flown away, but preſently after, forgetting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherein they were before, they have all of them returned to the ſame Tree. And do not we reſemble theſe ſilly birds? when death comes to our houſes, and takes away any one of us, we are all amazed, and we preſently think, that the next courſe may be ours, and therefore that it behooves us to reform our lives: but preſently after, when the remembrance of death is out of our minds, we return again to our former courſes. But he that will be provided againſt the coming of death, muſt alwayes have death in his remembrance. <hi>Tota vita ſapientis debet eſſe meditatio mortis,</hi> The whole life (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi>) of a wiſe man, ought to be a meditation of death. That as the birth of ſin was the death of man, ſo the meditation of death may be the death of ſin.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>David</hi> here by comparing us <hi>to graſſe, and the flowers of the field,</hi> implyeth thereby the certainty of our death, that we ſhall as certainly die, as we are ſure that theſe ſhall fade and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So he implyeth hereby the ſhortneſſe of our life, that we ſhall not live long, but ſhall die ſoon, as the graſſe and flowers do fade and decay in a ſhort time. <hi>Theodorus Gaza</hi> tels us of a father that had twelve ſons, and each of thoſe brethren had thirty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet every one of them expired ſoon. The father expired within the compaſſe of a year, never a one of his ſons but expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a moneth, and never a one of their children but expired in a day.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:118276:42"/>
            <p>Though this be ſpoken of the Year, which hath twelve months, and every month thirty dayes, yet their expiring ſo ſoone may well put us in mind of ours, ſeeing the ſhortneſs of our life is ſuch, that we are not ſure we ſhall live a year, no not a month; nay, though we be now wel for ought we know, yet for ought we know we may be dead before to morrow.</p>
            <p>How many have we known, that have been well and lively in one houre, and yet dead the next? how many are there in this Land, that were alive this morning and dead before noon? Nay, how many are there in the World that are now alive, and ſince thou haſt read theſe words (are now alive) are now dead? who no doubt made reckoning, as many now do, that they ſhould have lived a long time.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture teacheth us to make another account, by joyning together, as many times it doth, the day of our birth, and the day of our death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.2.</note> without making any mention of the time of our life, as if our lifetime were ſo ſhort, that it were not worth the naming. So <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Job</hi> 14.2.</note> 
               <hi>The day of death is better then the day of mans birth. So Job. Man that is borne of a Woman is of few dayes, and full of trouble, he comes up like a flower and is cut down.</hi> Upon which words, <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>In ipſo ſtatim introitu, de exitu quo<expan>

            <p>And hence it is, that we are often in the Scripture compared to thoſe things, which are of the ſhorteſt abode and continuance. So our bodies are compared to veſſells of earth; <hi>we have,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>this treaſure in earthen Veſſells.</hi> He compares them not to Veſſells of braſſe, or Iron, which will laſt long, but to earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells which are ſoone broken.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Potters</hi> ſhop there are Veſſels ye know, of divers ſorts, ſome leſſe ſome greater, ſome made for one uſe and ſome for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but all ſo brittle, that a little force will break any of them to peeces.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the frailty of our mortall bodies, ſome are ſtronger and more durable then other, but yet none ſo ſtrong, but that a little ſickneſs will ſoone pull him down, and bring him to nothing. Nay, earthen Veſſells, howſoever they be brittle, yet if we let them alone, if we ſet them up ſafe, and keep them from falling, they will continue the ſame for a longtime; but ſuch is our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118276:43"/>that we never continue in one ſtay, but though we look never ſo carefully to our ſelves, though we avoid all occaſions of coming into danger; yet before it be long, even age will conſume us.</p>
            <p>So we are compared by St. <hi>James</hi> to a vapour, that appeares for a while, and preſently vaniſhes; ſo by <hi>Job</hi> to a <hi>Weavers</hi> ſhuttle, that makes no ſtay in the <hi>Webbe,</hi> but paſſeth in a trice from one ſide to the other. So to a Garment that is ſoon worne out, to a tale that is, ſoone told, to a ſpan which is ſoone meaſured, and here to the graſſe and flowers of the field which are ſoone wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
            <p>The field we ſee hath variety of flowers, but none of them all do continue long but come up and are cut down, and others grow up in their roome. So it is likewiſe with the owners of thoſe fields, they are ſoon gone, and others ſucceed them. There is not any field, that hath had ſuch variety of flowers in it, as owners of it the ſame field which thou holdeſt, hath been held by thouſands before thee, who held it for a while one after another, and leſt it to thee, as thou muſt leave it to others after thee: and thou doſt not know, whether thy ſelf or the flowers which ſpring up in thy field ſhall be gone ſooneſt; <hi>for thy dayes are but as graſſe, and as the flowers of the field, ſo thou flouriſheſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you aske why God hath made our life ſo ſhort, the anſwer is, that it is his goodneſs and mercy towards us, to ſhorten our dayes. For though <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> complained at the time of his death, that nature had given to <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Ravens</hi> a long time of life, but a ſhort time to man, who could better have imployed the benefit of time; yet indeed it is his mercy towards us that we live not ſo long, becauſe he ſaw that a ſhort life would be better for us in divers reſpects.</p>

            <p>To draw then to a concluſion of all, we have briefly heard, why we are here reſembled <hi>to the graſſe and flowers of the field;</hi> and from

That we ſhall die we all know, but the moſt of us deceive our ſelves in this, that we put off the day of our death ſtil further from us: vvhen we are young, we think we ſhal live til we come to be old, when we come to be old we think we may live longer, and ſo we put off the time of our death ſtill further and further. And hence it is, that we are ſo carefull for the things of this life, as if this World were the place where we ſhould live for ever. We read of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that to ſhew his affection to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> he willed him to aske what he would of him, and he would give it him. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> deſired him to give him the fee-ſimple of his life, that he might be free from death. O ſaith <hi>Alexander,</hi> if I could do this, I would do it for my ſelf, why then it ſeemes (ſaith the <hi>Philoſopher</hi>) that you are mortall. True, ſaith <hi>Alexander.</hi> Indeed ſaith the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that you are mortall, I do not doubt, yet I greatly doubt whether you think that you are mortall, and ſhall ever die, becauſe you live ſo, as if you thought you were immortall, and ſhould never die. The like may be ſaid to many of us; for though we cannot deny, but muſt needes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we ſhall ſurely die, yet man, live ſo, they ſeek ſo greedily after worldly goods, they ſo pamper their bodies, and are ſo ſumptuons in their buildings, as if they were immortall, and ſhould never die. The <hi>Patriarcks</hi> though they lived ſo many years, yet they lived in Tents and in poor Cabins; but we that live not the half of their dayes, do build our houſes ſo faire and ſo dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as if we meant here to ſet up our reſt, and that we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from hence, which argues that though we know we ſhall die,<note place="margin">Theatr.

Like <hi>Meſſodanus</hi> a holy old man, who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by his friend to dinner for the morrow after. Why, ſaith he, do you invite me to morrow to dinner? I have not looked to live till to morrow this many a year. For we no ſooner begin to live, but we begin to die, and look how many dayes of our life are paſt, ſo much of our life is already cut off, and the leſſe is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as the more of an Houre-glaſſe is already run out, the leſſe it hath to runne.</p>

            <p>And ſecondly, ſeeing we ſhall ſo ſoone die, it may therefore teach us ſo to live, as that death when it comes, may be welcome, and not fearfull unto us, and that is, by preparing our ſelves againſt the coming of death, by a godly life. For this is the comfort which a man can find when he lieth on his Death-bed, that he ſhall enter into a better life when this life is ended, and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort he cannot have at his death, unleſs he have lived a godly life: Death to the wicked may well be fearfull, becauſe as it is in it own nature, it is the wages of ſinne, and impoſed as a curſe and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon man for his tranſgreſſion; but by virtue of Chriſts death to the godly it is otherwiſe, ceaſing to be a curſe unto them, nay, of a curſe it is made a bleſſing, even a paſſage out of a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life into the Kingdom of Heaven.

            <p>Secondly, The manner how vve muſt reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>And firſt for the perſon, it is the Devill, vvhoſe name vvhich is here given him doth ſignifie an accuſer. And indeed his name is not given him for nought, but as <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid of <hi>Nabal, Nabal is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118276:45"/>his name and folly is with him,</hi> ſo it may truly be ſaid of the devill,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.</note> 
               <hi>Accuſer is his name, and accuſation is with him:</hi> for his chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light hath been in ſlandering and accuſing even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Somtime accuſing God unto man, as he accuſed God of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, to alienate mans affection from God: and ſomtime again, to alienate Gods affection from man: he accuſeth on the other ſide man unto God, as he accuſed <hi>Job.</hi> And therefore he is called in the 12th. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,: The accuſer of our brethren, which accuſed them before God day and night.</hi> Now as a man that is to encounter with an Enemy, it is neceſſary that he know what his Enemy is, what weapons he will uſe, and what ſtrength, and courage, and cunning he hath, that knowing them before-hand, he may provide himſelf the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make reſiſtance. So it is neceſſary for us to know what our Adverſary is whom we are to reſiſt, and therefore the Scripture doth ſet him out in his lively colours, and inſtructs us before-hand how ſubtile, how malicious, and how powerfull he is.</p>
            <p>And firſt for his ſubtilty, he is called a Serpent, which ye know, is more ſubtile then any beaſt of the field: and this is the firſt name which the Scripture gives him. For he doth not alwayes roar like a Lion, but for the moſt part he lieth in wait like a Serpent, prevailing far more by his craft &amp; policy, then by his ſtrength and power. Therefore it is <hi>that he will not appear in his own likeneſſe, but like as the wife of Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. <hi>diſgniſed her ſelfe when ſhe came to the Prophet, that ſhe might deceive him.</hi> So the devill, <hi>though he be the Prince of darkneſſe, yet he transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into an Angel of light that he may beguile us.</hi> For if he ſhould ſhew himſelf as he is, and in his own nature, then as one ſaith, <hi>Semel videris ſemper oder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore like <hi>Proteus</hi> he transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſomtimes into one ſhape, and ſomtimes into another, as he did into a Serpent, when he deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> who little ſuſpected that it was the devill. Now beſides his transforming and diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe, he hath <hi>mille nocendi artes,</hi> a thouſand wayes to deceive and beguile us. When he comes to tempt us to any ſin, he will ſhew us the bait, but not the hook, the pleaſure of ſin, but not the danger of it. Ye know when he tempted our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, <hi>he ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them,</hi> but for the ſorrow and miſery, the vanity and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which were in the world, thoſe he would not ſhew him. And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118276:46"/>ſo doth the devill deal with us when he comes to tempt us. He ſhews us the profit, the pleaſure and delight, which we ſhall reap by ſin, but for the ſorrow and miſery, the puniſhment and ſhame which ſhall attend upon ſin, he hides and conceals them, yet that he may the better prevaile againſt us, he watcheth the time when we are at the weakeſt, and then takes the opportunity to ſet upon us. When <hi>David</hi> fled from his Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> it was the counſell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> to purſue him in the night time while he was weary with travelling;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</note> and it was the policy of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> (<hi>Judges</hi> 16) to ſet upon <hi>Sampſon,</hi> while he was at the weakeſt, and leaſt able to reſiſt them. And thus deals our ſpirituall enemy with us, he watcheth the time when we are at the weakeſt, and then takes the opportunity, when he thinks us leaſt able to reſiſt his temptations, <hi>When the Husbandman had ſowed good ſeed in his ground, Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>the enemy watched the time when men were aſleep, and then he ſowed tares among the wheat.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was fallen aſleep, <hi>Marke</hi> 14. <hi>Watch and pray</hi> (ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>leaſt ye fall into temptation;</hi> intimating thereby, That then the devill is moſt ready to tempt us, when he findes us leaſt fit to reſiſt his temptations. Thus when he tempted our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, that he might the better prevaile againſt them, he ſet upon <hi>Eve</hi> the weaker veſſell, and withall took the advantage of her husbands abſence, as thinking ſhe might the ſooner be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now ſhe was alone. Thus that he might the better prevaile againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> he watched the time when Chriſt was taken, as thinking that then (if ever) he might be drawn <hi>to deny his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> when he could not acknowledge him but with great danger. And thus that he might the better prevaile againſt our Saviour, he watched the time when he was hungry with faſting, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it moſt likely, that if ever he could bring him to doubt of Gods favour, now was the time when he had faſted ſo long, and God had provided no ſuſtenance for him. And therefore he then laid his ſnares for Chriſt, when he ſaw be was hungry, and had no ſuſtenance, as the Fowler layeth his limed ears of corn in a hard froſt, when he ſees that the birds are ready to famiſh. And thus he continually ſets upon us when we are at the weakeſt, and leaſt able, as he thinks, to make reſiſtance. And as he watcheth the time when we are at the weakeſt, ſo he tempts us in thoſe things wherein we are the weakeſt, by examining every mans diſpoſition and humour, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſing him eſpecially to thoſe ſins;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118276:46"/>whereunto by nature he is moſt prone and inclinable. For like as a man that goeth a fiſhing, he will have ſeverall kinds of baits for ſeverall kinds of fiſh, becauſe every fiſh will not bite at every baite, but ſome are taken ſooner with one kind of bait, and ſome with another: ſo the devill hath ſeverall baits for ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and before he tempts any man, he will conceive with what baite he will ſooneſt be taken. If he perceive that Chriſt is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with faſting, he will preſent him with <hi>ſtones to be made bread,</hi> if he perceive that <hi>Ahab</hi> is covetous, and that he hath a deſire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his poſſeſſions, he vvill preſent him with <hi>Naboths</hi> vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
            <p>That like as <hi>Saluſt</hi> writes of <hi>Catilin</hi> a Traytor in <hi>Rome,</hi> that to draw others into the ſame conſpiracy with him, he uſed this policy, to fit every man according to his diſpoſition, giving horſes to thoſe that delighted in riding, Hounds to ſuch as took pleaſure in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to every man thoſe things vvhich beſt liked him: So doth the Devill, he obſerves to what ſinne a man is moſt inclining, and fits his temptations as they are moſt agreeable to every mans hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>And as his ſubtilty appeares, both in watching the time when we are at the weakeſt, and obſerving what temptation is fitteſt for us: ſo likewiſe in this, that he begins at firſt with ſmaller ſinnes, and drawes us on by degrees to evill, making the leſſe ſinnes like ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler wedges, to make way for greater. For he knowes that a man will ſooner yield at the firſt to a little ſinne, that ſinne will grow in the heart as the child growes in the wombe: and that if he can bring us to give entertainment but to an angry thought (though we count this but a ſmall matter) yet it will grow from the heart to the tongue, and from the tongue to the hand, ſo that many like <hi>Cain</hi> begin with anger and end with murder. For he knows that little ſinnes, if we yield unto them, will grow to be great ones and will procure our ruin.</p>
            <p>The Swallow in the Fable, when ſhe ſaw the Husband-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſow Hemp-ſeed in his field, ſhe counſelled the Birds to peck it up: becauſe otherwiſe if it were let alone it would prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for them. The Birds could not ſee how ſo ſmall a ſeed ſhould do them any harme; but afterward vvhen it vvas grovvn ripe and vvas cut dovvn, the Husband-man made ſnares and nets of the Hemp vvhereby the Birds vvere taken. Thoſe little ſinnes vvhich vve thinke ſo ſmall that they can do us no harme; yet the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118276:47"/>Devill vvill uſe them as ſnares to intrap us, and to vvork our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And therefore he vvill begin vvith ſmall ſinnes, and dravv us on by degrees from the leſſe to the greater, as he drew on <hi>Peter</hi> from lying to perjury; and <hi>David</hi> from adultery to commit murder. And yet that he may the more eaſily deceive us, what ſin ſoever he tempts us unto, he will commonly ſet ſuch a Gloſſe upon it, that it ſhall ſeem to be either no ſinne at all, or a very ſmall matter till we have committed it. Nay, that which is ſtrange, many times when he tempts a man to never ſo hainous a ſinne; yet he will make him believe that it is a good vvork, and that he ſhall deſerve commendation, and reward for the doing of it: as when he tempted <hi>Paul</hi> to perſecute the Church, he made him believe that he did God good ſervice: and when he perſwads the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to the murdering of Princes, he make them believe that it is a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke, and puts them in hope of being rewarded by God, as the <hi>Amalekite</hi> was in hope of being rewarded by <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16.</note> for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him word that he had killed King <hi>Saul,</hi> and inſtead of a reward he was executed for it.</p>
            <p>And as his ſubtiltie appears in tempting us to evill under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of good: ſo likewiſe in tempting us to do that vvhich is good but to an evill end. As vvhen he tempts us vvith the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to give almes in publicke, and openly in the ſight and view of the world, that vve may be ſeene of men and commended for it. The giving of Almes is a good deed, and to give them in publick is likewiſe lawfull, that others may be moved to do the like by our example. But the Devill knows that though it be a good deed, yet if a man do it openly for vaine glory, the good deed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes evill in the doer of it: and therefore he vvill tempt a man to do that vvhich is good, where he ſees it vvill be a ſinne in him that doth it. And indeed, his craft and ſubtiltie is ſuch, &amp; he hath ſo many vvays to deceive and beguile us, that vve have great cauſe to ſear all our vvorks leſt we be taken vvith his hook at unawars. He will do the beſt he can, to turn thoſe good gifts vvhich God gives unto men, to be occaſions of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Thus many times vvhere God gives Knovvledge and Learning, the Divill allures men thereby to pride; vvhere God gives beauty, the Devill allures men thereby to vvantonneſſe; vvhere God gives ſtrength the Devill abuſeth it to do wrong &amp; violence; and vvhere God gives vvit, the Devill turns it to gibing &amp; ſcoffing at others; Yet ſtill vvhen he tempts a man to ſin, he vvill extenuate the ſame
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118276:47"/>make it ſeeme leſſe, and to make him to yield the more eaſily unto it, he will perſwade him that God is infinitely mercifull, and that he daily pardons many ſinnes of many that are far greater. When he hath brought a man to yield to his temptation, then he labours to make him continue in his ſinne, by putting him in hope that he hath a long time to live, and that he may repent him when he comes to be old, and all in good time. And when he hath now brought him to this, that he ſees him continue ſecure in his ſinnes, then he will go a degree further, he will labour to hinder him from hearing the word, from praying unto God, and from all other meanes that might bring him to repentance: as the enemy when he hath beſieged a City, he will ſtop all the paſſages, and will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any from coming to the City for their aide and aſſiſtance. And theſe are indeed his moſt uſuall vviles whereby he deceives us.</p>
            <p>And as he is ſubtil, ſo he is very malicious. He would deale with us (if God would ſuffer him) as he dealt with <hi>Job:</hi> he would take away from us all that ever we have, and would leave us nothing, unleſſe it were that which might do us harme; as when God gave him leave to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> he took away his goods, his Servants and his Children, but left him his wife to be a croſſe unto him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that he is called our adverſary: your adverſary, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>Like a roaring Lyon, walkes about ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi> For ſuch is his malice, that he is never at reſt, but goes compaſſing the earth from one end to the other,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 1.7.</note> ſeeking the deſtruction of the vvhole race of <hi>Adam,</hi> both in body and ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now if ye ask the reaſon, why the Devill is ſo maliciouſly ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt man: the reaſon is plain, becauſe that man is the Image of God. The Devil bears infinite hatred to God for caſting him out of Heaven, and becauſe he cannot do God any harme; yet he ſeekes maliciouſly to deface his Image, and to be revenged upon man: not unlike the Panther, whoſe hatred towards man is ſo implacable, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, that if he ſee but a mans Picture, he will ſet furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon it, and tear it in peeces.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As his ſubtilty and malice are great, ſo likewiſe is his power. Therefore Chriſt calles him the Prince of this World, to ſhew that his power is very great. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he tells us, <hi>that we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers:</hi> he councells us twice in the ſame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118276:48"/>Chapter, to take and put on the whole Armour of God, that ſo we might be able to reſiſt his temptations. We ſee then what this enemy is whom we are exhorted to reſiſt, one that is both ſubtil, and powerfull, and malicious. Though he were never ſo malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt us, yet if he were not powerfull withall, like a curſt Cow, as the Proverb is, that hath ſhort hornes, for want of power to effect his malice, we might fear him the leſſe. Or though he were both malicious and powerfull, yet if he were not ſubtil and crafty vvithall, the danger vvere the leſſe, becauſe there vvere ſome hope that vve might over-reach him by ſome meanes or other; but being both ſubtil, malicious and powerfull, it behoves us to be more careful to make reſiſtance. And ſo from the perſon whom we muſt reſiſt. I come to the manner how we muſt reſiſt him.</p>
            <p>The word which is here tranſlated to reſiſt, doth ſignifie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and to ſtand againſt as it were face to face, to note unto us, that we are not to yield and to turn our backs,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.48.49.</note> but to ſtand man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt him when he doth aſſault us. That as <hi>David</hi> when he was to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> he went againſt him and ſtruck him in the forehead: So we vvhenſoever we are aſſaulted by the Devill, are to ſtand againſt him face to face, and not to turn our backs like the Children of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in the day of battle.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 78.9.</note> Therefore we are ſtill commanded in the Scripture, to fight, to vvreſtle, to quit our ſelves like men, to withſtand and to reſiſt, but never to flie and to turn our backs.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.</note> And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> vvhere he particularly ſets down the vvhole Armour of a Chriſtian; vvhich vve are to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſpiritual enemy, yet he mentions not any part for the back: there is an Helmet for the head, a Courſelet for the breaſt, a Sword for the hand, Sandals for the feet, and a Shield to gard all the foreparts; but for the back and the hinder parts there is no Armour at all; to note unto us that we are manfully to ſtand againſt him, and not to turn our backs vvhen he doth aſſault us.</p>
            <p>Now further, for the manner how vve are to reſiſt him, we muſt deal vvith this Enemy as men do in Warre vvhen a City is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiedged.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They ſhut up the Gates and make all faſt, to keep the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy from making entrance. And thus muſt vve do, vve muſt ſhut up as it vvere the Gates of our ſenſes, vve muſt turn away our eyes from beholding vanity, vve muſt ſtop our eares from hearing vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vve muſt ſtrengthen every part and look that all be faſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118276:48"/>if he find any part to be vveaker then other, he vvill break in upon us.</p>
            <p>We read <hi>Judges</hi> 18. that the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi> having no Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance nor poſſeſſion of their own among the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they vvent up and down like ſpies to ſurvey the Country, and finding the City <hi>Laiſh</hi> to be vveakly guarded, the Inhabitants thereof being careleſs and ſecure, and otherwiſe buſied, they made towards it, they beſieged it, and having conquered all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, they took poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Devill</hi> having loſt the right of his own Inheritance, and having no poſſeſſion of his own among the Children of God, he vvanders up and down like a ſpie, and finding the ſoul of man to be meanly fortified, the Inhabitants thereof, the vvit, memory, vvill, underſtanding being unprovided, he ſets upon it, and finding little or no reſiſtance, he eaſily takes it, and therefore it behoves us to keep vvatch continually, and to look carefully to our ſelves, that we give him no entrance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt not only be carefull to keep him out vvhen he doth beſiege us; but vvithall vve muſt be carefull, and do our beſt endeavour to raiſe his ſiedge, vve muſt do the beſt vve can to beat him from the aſſault, and to put him to flight. And this is done by the vvord of God, vvhich is called by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> the Svvord of the Spirit.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17.</note> Therefore vvhen our <hi>Saviour</hi> vvas tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Devill, Matth.</hi> 4. the only Weapon vvhereby he repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him vvas the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to teach us that hovvſoever he doth aſſault us, vve muſt betake our ſelves to the Word of God to reſiſt his temptations.

               <hi>what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole World, and to loſe his own ſoule?</hi> If he tempt us to pride and vain glory, we muſt ſay it is written, <hi>God reſiſts the proud and gives grace to the humble.</hi> If he tempt us to malice, we muſt ſay it is written, <hi>He that hates his Brother is a murderer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>James</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15.</note> If he tempt us to uncleanneſs, we muſt ſay it is written, <hi>Marriage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable among all men, and the bed undefiled;</hi> but <hi>Whoremaſters</hi> and <hi>Adulterers</hi> God will judge. In a word,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4.</note> what ſin ſoever he tempts us unto, we may find in the Scripture wherewithall we are to withſtand his Aſſaults. For the Scripture is like the Tower of <hi>David, Cantic.</hi> 4.4. that was built for an Armory, a Thouſand Bucklers (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) do hang thereon, and all the ſhields of mighty men; and from thence we may fetch what Weapons ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118276:49"/>we are to uſe againſt our ſpirituall enemies, and without which we can never repell their temptations.</p>
            <p>And therefore this ſhewes their extreame folly, that regard not to have any knowledge in the Scriptures; For how ſhall their hands be able to warre and their fingers to fight that are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the word of God, and know not how to handle the ſword of the Spirit? Such muſt needs be in a fearfull caſe, becauſe they do voluntarily diſarme themſelves, and caſt away their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and ſo betray their ſouls into the hands of the Devill, while they have not where withall to reſiſt his temptations.</p>
            <p>If a man had an enemy that had vowed his death, how carefull would he be to provide himſelf Weapons, and to get ſome cunning how to uſe the ſame, for the ſafeguard and preſervation of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life. How carefull then ſhould every one be for his ſoules ſafety, to put on the whole armour of God, and to learne to uſe aright this ſword of the Spirit; that when Sathan his mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my aſſaults him, he may be the better provided to withſtand him.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Hanniball</hi> a <hi>Carthaginean</hi> Captaine, that as long as <hi>Scipio</hi> his enemy was in the field and ready continually to bid him battle, he was alwayes afraid leſt he he ſhould be ſuddenly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and therefore never ſlept but with his armour on, and with a guard of Souldiers to keep watch about him. And we read of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. That while he ſlept in the field, he had his ſpeare in a readineſs ſtuck up at his Boulſter: And ſo ſhould we, while we are in this World, which is as it were the field of temptation, wherein vve are ſo often aſſaulted by Sathan; we ſhould alwayes have the Word of God in a readines, that whenſoever he aſſailes us, vve may be able to vvithſtand him. But hovv farre are the moſt (eſpecially they that are in their youthful dayes) from doing thus? Tell them of reſiſting the Devills temptations, forſaking their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and betaking themſelves unto Gods ſervice, they vvill be ready to ſay. Why art thou come to torment us before the time. <hi>Alios mores hee atas poſtulat.</hi> Our youth requires other kind of manners, and it is needleſſe for us to do thus till vve be grovvn in yeares. For young men do commonly make account that they ſhall live long, that God vvill allovv them more liberty vvhile they are young, and vvill not require ſo much of them as of old men. But they ſhould rather conſider that which experience may teach them, that they vvho are young are as vvell ſubject to death as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118276:49"/>they who are ancient, like glaſſe which is as, brittle when it is newly made as when it is old, and ſo though they be young yet they may die ſoone; and therefore need alwayes to be in a readines againſt God ſhall call them. They ſhould conſider that which reaſon may teach them, that the longer it is before they ſeek God, the longer it will be before they can find him; as the further a man ſtrayes out of his way, the longer it will be before he can find the ſame. And they ſhould conſider that which the Scripture teacheth them, that young men as well as old ſhal be called to an account at the day of Judgement of all they have done. And they ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the precept which the Apoſtle gives here, not in the future but in the preſent time, <hi>Reſiſt the Devill,</hi> not reſiſt him hereafter. If God as they imagine, regard not what they do in their youthfull daies, what needed <hi>David</hi> to pray,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Remember not the ſinnes of my youth;</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſay, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the daies of thy youth.</hi> Why did God in the old Law, command that young <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> ſhould be offered unto him? Or Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel forbid that young children ſhould be kept from him? but to ſhew that our youth is to be conſecrated to God, and to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Religion. If they think it too ſoon to forſake their ſinnes, and to begin to ſerve God in their younger yeares: God will think it too late when they come to be old, to entertaine them to be his Servants; and as they have ſpent the greateſt part of their time in the Devills ſervice; ſo God will leave them to him whoſe work they have done, to pay them their wages. We our ſelves will be loth to take ſuch a ſervant as is lame or old, and ſo unfit or unable to do us ſervice, eſpecially if he be one who while he was young and ſtrong refuſed to ſerve us: And do we think that God when we have refuſed to ſerve him in our younger years will be content to receive us, when we are old and impotent to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?

If God count it abominable for a man to have divers meaſures, a greater for himſelf &amp; a leſſe for his neighbour or a greater for his friend &amp; a leſſe for a ſtranger; How abhominable then muſt it needs be to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118276:50"/>God, when we have divers meaſures for God and his enemies, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinne and Sathan, with the beſt and greateſt part of our lives, and alotting the leaſt and the worſt part unto Gods ſervice. And therefore it behoves us ever while we are young, to reſiſt and withſtand the Devills temptations, to renounce our pleaſures and to betake our ſelves unto Gods ſervice. And thus much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former part of theſe words, <hi>Reſiſt the Devill.</hi> I come now to the reaſon, which I will diſpatch briefly. <hi>Reſiſt the Devill and he will ſee from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devill though he be fierce when he gives the firſt aſſault, yet where he finds reſiſtance he will break up the ſiege and fly like a coward. Ye know when he tempted our Saviour Chriſt in the fourth chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> though he gave the firſt blow, yet he took the laſt; and though he gave the on-ſet and ſet firſt upon him, yet he was the firſt that ſounded the retreate, and was glad to leave him.</p>
            <p>But it may be demanded, Whether the Devill will flee if he be reſiſted? Will he flee into Hell and be ſeen no more? No, that he will not; but if he flee from tho godly, he will be ſure to take his pleaſure of the wicked, and he will make them pay for it; If he cannot prevaile againſt our Saviour, he will enter into <hi>Judas;</hi> if he cannot have his will of men, yet rather then faile he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Swine:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 8.32.</note> as a Hauke when ſhe cannot ſpeed of her prey, ſhe will ſeaſe upon carrion; But though the Devill flee when we reſiſt him, yet we muſt not be ſecure; for though he can not ſpeed at the firſt aſſault, yet he will come againe: as when he took the foile in tempting our Saviour, <hi>he departed from him</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 4.13. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.40.</note> 
               <hi>but for a ſeaſon.</hi> He is not like the <hi>Sadduces, Luke</hi> 20. who were ſo confounded with our Saviours anſwers, that they never durſt ask him any more queſtions; but being overcome yet he will come againe: like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who though he were faine to let the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go, yet they were no ſooner gone but he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued them; or like the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> (<hi>Judges</hi> 16.) who though they had often ſet upon <hi>Sampſon</hi> and could not prevaile, yet they would not give him over but ſtill aſſaulted him. For though the Devill do take the foile, yet he will not quite give over; but when he ſees that he cannot prevaile one way, he will try if he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile another. We ſee when God had given him leave to afflict <hi>Job.</hi> to try whether he could draw him to impatientie, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill had taken away all his goods, killed his ſervants, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118276:50"/>his children, and could not in all this prevaile againſt him; yet he would not leave him thus, but got leave of God to aſſault him afreſh, and to afflict his whole body with ſores and ulcers; for he knows that our weaknes and infirmity is ſuch, that though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevaile one way; yet another he may prevaile againſt us. If he cannot prevaile againſt <hi>David</hi> to lay hands on <hi>Saul</hi> the Lords annointed, yet he will try if he can tempt him to murder <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> If he cannot draw the <hi>Phariſee</hi> to extortion, adultery and the like Vices, he will go another way to work, and try if he can make him proud of his virtues.</p>
            <p>And ſo though he be vanquiſht in one temptation, yet he will tempt us again; &amp; therefore we are not to be ſecure, but after that one temptation is paſt, we muſt expect and prepare our ſelves for another; yet this is our comfort, that though the Devill aſſault us never ſo often, yet God that here exhorts us to reſiſt the Devill, will likewiſe help us to overcome him. <hi>Qui hortatur ut pugnes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juvabit ut vincas,</hi> He ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that exhorts thee to fight, vvill likevviſe help thee to get the victory. If thou be ready to ſink like <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.31.</note> he vvill put forth his hand to keep thee from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: nay, if thou fall like <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he vvill not ſuffer thee to be quite overcome;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 22.61.</note> but he will look back upon thee with the eye of mercy, and will raiſe thee again; For as the Devill encounters thee with new aſſaults: ſo God will ſupply thee with freſh forces, and his grace (if thou be but carefull to reſiſt the Devill) ſhall be ſufficient for thee againſt all his Temptations.</p>

And of this kind of evil the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That there ſhal be no ſuch evil, no not in a whole City, but the Lord hath done it,</hi> that is the Lord hath decreed it to be done: for ye ſee the Prophet ſpeaks of a future evill, <hi>Shall there be evill?</hi> and yet he ſaith, <hi>that the Lord hath done it,</hi> becauſe in his decreed it.

So we ſee when the devill afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> God ſuffered him to take away all his goods, to kill his children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to afflict his whole body with ſores and ulcers, but he muſt ſtay there, God hath given him a charge concerning his life, and he can go no further.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 2.6.</note> God diſpoſeth of our afflictions for their time and continuance, and ſets down their limits vvhen they ſhall end and ceaſe.

            <p>Firſt, Seeing God is the Authour of all afflictions, it may teach us this, <hi>That whenſoever we are in any diſtreſſe, we are to paſſe by all ſecond cauſes, and look ſpecially upon God, as the principall Agent in all our afflictions.</hi> Many take notice of the means or inſtrument whereby they are afflicted, but look not up unto him that ſent is: as the dog flieth upon the ſtone that is thrown at him, but mindeth not him that threw it, but in every affliction we look up to God as the principall Agent. Thus when <hi>Shimei</hi> reviled <hi>David.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. telling him openly before all the people, that he was a murderer and a wicked man, and that he was an uſurper of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118276:52"/>
               <hi>Sauls</hi> Kingdom, and <hi>Davids</hi> Servants would have ſtain <hi>Shemei</hi> for railing on him, <hi>David</hi> would not ſuffer them to do him any harm, and he gives this reaſon, <hi>Suffer him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to curſe me for the Lord hath bidden him:</hi> and ſo he looks not upon <hi>Shimei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11.</note> but he hath an eye unto God as the Authour of this affliction. Thus when the Devill had got a licence from God to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> on the one ſide took away his oxen as they were plowing, and his aſſes as they were feeding in their places, and the <hi>Calde ans</hi> on the other ſide took away his Camels, and put his ſervants to the edge of the ſword, <hi>Job</hi> though he underſtood by his ſervants that it was done by them, yet he paſſeth them by as being but the inſtruments, and aſcribes it to God as the principall Agent. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath given,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> And thus when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was afflicted by his brethren, and ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> though he knew that this was done by them, and that of an evill intent and meer malice towards him, yet he looks not upon them, but he looks upon God as the Author of his affliction.<note place="margin">

               <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſent me hither for your preſervation, and the Lord hath diſpoſed it unto good.</hi> So that whenſoever we are any way afflicted, we are to paſſe by all ſecond cauſes, as being but the means and inſtruments which God uſeth to afflict us, but we are eſpecially to have an eye unto God, as to the principall Agent, and to remember that it is God that chaſtens us.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7.</note> he offers himſelf as a father unto us, therefore we are patiently to under go all afflictions that he ſhall lay upon us. <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philoſopher being viſited with ſickneſſe, and being impatient by reaſon of his pain, his friend to comfort him, willed him to be of good chear, and to bear it with patience, becauſe God was the Authour of his ſickneſſe. Oh, ſaith the Philoſopher, but this is that which grieves me the more, this is that which maketh me the more impatient, ſeeing that my
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118276:53"/>ſickneſſe is ſent of God. But it is not ſo with the children of God, they are always the more patient when they are afflicted, and do bear the ſame without murmuring and repining, becauſe God is the Authour of their afflication. So when old <hi>Eli</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>Samuel,</hi> what God had threatned, <hi>even to root out his houſe for ever,</hi> he ſubmitted himſelf unto Gods will, <hi>It is</hi> (faith he) <hi>the Lord,</hi>

               <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> The like did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39. when the hand of the Lord was ſo heavy upon him, that it even conſumed him, yet he bare it patiently, <hi>I became</hi> (faith he) <hi>dumb, and opened not my mouth, for it was thy doing.</hi> When <hi>Jobs</hi> wife would have had him to blaſpheme, and to curſe God in the extreamity of his pain,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, like a fooliſh woman, ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evill?</hi> as thinking it unreaſonable, that we ſhould be content to receive the one, and not the other. If our earthly parents do chaſten and correct us, we will endure it with patience, and ſhould we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the chaſtiſement and correction of our heavenly Father? <hi>We have had</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, here in the <hi>9th. verſe) the fathers of our bodies which have corrected us, and we have given them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſhould we not</hi> (faith he) <hi>much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of ſpirits?</hi> We will ſuffer the Phyſician in the time of our ſickneſſe (becauſe he hath ſeen our water, or felt our pulſe) to let us bloud, we will ſuffer him to preſcribe us a leſſe diet, and to take away from us the uſe of ſome meats, wherein in our health we were much delighted, and we will patiently endure the want thereof, and not murmure againſt him. And ſhould we not yield as much unto God, as we do to the Phyſician? yet if God take away from us any of thoſe things wherein we were wont to take comfort and delight; if he afflict us with the loſſe of our goods, with the loſſe of our health, or with the loſſe of our friends, we preſently fall into great impatiencie, as if ſo be God dealt too hardly with us: But doth not God know what is beſt for us? if he afflict thee with the loſſe of thy goods, he fore-ſaw (it may be) they would have done thee harm, and that thou would'ſt have ſet thy heart upon them. <hi>Niſi perdidiſſes tu illa te fortè perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſent,</hi> faith <hi>Seneca.</hi> If God had not withdrawn thy riches from thee, it may be, thy riches would have withdrawn thee from God. If God take away thy health, and afflict thee with ſicknes, it may be, it is to cure thee of a more dangerous diſeaſe, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that otherwiſe if thou hadſt had thy health, thou wouldeſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118276:53"/>have taken a greater ſurfet of the pleaſures of this life.

                  <hi>Job</hi> 21.9.</note> ſaith of the wicked, are <hi>peaceable without fear, and the rod of God is not upon them:</hi> and as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the ungodly, they proſper in all their wayes, and flouriſh <hi>like a green bay-tree.</hi> It is true indeed, and cannot be denied, that the godly many times do ſuffer in this World more croſſes and afflictions then the wicked; but therefore we muſt remember that the puniſhment of the wicked is kept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till the World to come. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was farre more afflicted in this life, that lay full of ſores at the rich mans gates, and would have been glad of a morſell of bread; then the rich man was, that fared ſo ſumptuouſly and lived in pleaſure: but therefore what ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich man, <hi>Sonne,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 15.25.</note> 
               <hi>remember that then in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and Lazarus evill, but now is he comforted and thou art tormented.</hi> Whenſoever therefore we ſee the godly to live in affliction and miſery, and the wicked in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and hearts-eaſe, yet it need not trouble us, becauſe there will come a time when the wicked ſhall be puniſht and the godly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, <hi>When the godly ſhall have all their teares wiped from their eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.17.</note> 
               <hi>and the wicked ſhall ſuffer Gods wrath and vengeance;</hi> for if God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and chaſten ſuch as he loves, much leſſe ſhall the wicked eſcape Gods judgements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Seeing God doth chaſten thoſe whom he loves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>this may therefore teach us to beware of cenſuring hardly of them, that are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtreſſe or affliction, as if this were an argument that they are out of Gods favour, and that God hath forſaken them.</hi> We are prone to judge, amiſſe of thoſe that are in diſtreſſe. If <hi>Job,</hi> be afflicted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 4.7.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4.</note> his friends will think that he is an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> If the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſee a <hi>Viper</hi> hang on <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, they will ſuſpect him therefore to have been a murderer: and if the <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſee the man that was born blind,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 9.2.</note> they will judge that either he or his Parents had ſinned, as if they muſt needes be wicked perſons that are afflicted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Samaritans</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes of them, when they ſaw that matters went proſperouſly with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they were wont to ſay then that they were come of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118276:55"/>under the Croſſe and ſuffered affliction, they would then derive their Pedegree from <hi>Babel</hi> and other Nations, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, as if only the wicked and not the godly were ſubject to affliction. But we ſee here that God chaſtens whom he loves, and therefore that we are not to judge hardly of ſuch as we ſee afflicted.</p>
            <p>And thus much likewiſe for the ſecond point, the Patient or party that is chaſtned by God, namely Gods beloved, <hi>He chaſtens whom he loves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to the third and laſt, the quality of the action in this word <hi>chaſtneth,</hi> which implyeth (as I ſaid) that God doth not torment and torture us like a tyranne, but he doth onely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten us, as a Father doth chaſten and correct his Children: theſe chaſtiſements do not proceed from God as an angry judge, for our plague and puniſhment, but as from a merciful and loving Father, for our correction and amendment; for herein he offers himſelf unto us as unto Sonnes, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith. So that theſe chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the godly are ſignes of their adoption, and pledges of Gods love and favour towards them, which that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the better, I purpoſe to ſhew you two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, vvhat theſe chaſtiſements are, or how God doth chaſten us.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, To what end they are, or why he doth chaſten us.</p>
            <p>Concerning the firſt, theſe chaſtiſements of God are ſometimes called in the Scripture the judgements of God: So they are called by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>The time,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is come, that judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.</note> That is to ſay, the judgement of chaſtiſement, for the judgements of God are of two ſorts, <hi>judicia caſtigationis, &amp; judicia vindicte &amp; condemnationis,</hi> the judgements of chaſtiſement or correction, and the judgments of revenge and condemnation.</p>
            <p>And this diſtinction is taken out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>When we,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</note> 
               <hi>are judged, we are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the World.</hi> So that there is a judgment of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement which lights upon the godly, and a judgment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which lights upon the wicked. And theſe judgements are ſometimes publick and generall, and ſometimes private and particular. Publick and generall, as when a whole Land or Country is afflicted; as either by Warre, by Plague and Peſtilence, by Death and Famin, and any other common and generall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:118276:55"/>
            <p>Thus we ſee, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. That when <hi>David</hi> had ſinned againſt God, by cauſing his people to be numbred, God to chaſten and correct him for it, offers him his choiſe of three publick afflictions, either a generall dearth and famin all over his Land,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.12.</note> for the ſpace of three years, or the Enemies to come and invade his Land, and prevail againſt him for the ſpace of three months, or a Plague and Peſtilence among his people for three dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> being in this extremity, did chooſe rather to fall into the hands of God then into the hands of men, becauſe there is mercy with the Lord in his chaſtiſements, and ſo there died of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence threeſcore and ten thouſand in three dayes. This was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or publick affliction.</p>
            <p>Sometime again they are privat or particular, as when any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular houſe or family, or any privat man is chaſtned and afflicted, and that either outwardly or inwardly: outwardly as by the loſſe of goods, by the loſſe of health, by the loſſe of friends, by the loſſe of liberty, and the like. And thus Gods Children are often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Some are afflicted with want and po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sometimes again, God doth inwardly chaſten us, as when either he leaves us for a time to our ſelves, ſo that we fall into ſome actual ſinnes, and are afterwards grieved that we have offended God.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was afflicted when he had denied our Saviour, and wept ſo bitterly for his denial. Or when God withdrawes from us the feeling of his love and the comfort of his ſpirit:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75.</note> So that we doubt for a time that God hath forſaken us, becauſe we can find no inward comfort. And thus <hi>David</hi> was afflicted when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained ſo grievouſly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7.</note> 
               <hi>Will the Lord abſent himſelf for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and will he ſhew no more favour? hath he forgotten to be gratious, and will he ſhut up his kindneſs in diſpleaſure?</hi> Theſe are inward cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements.</p>
            <p>Now God in all his chaſtiſements deales otherwiſe with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then he deales with the wicked. The one he chaſtens in love and mercy, the other he puniſheth in his wrath and fury: the one
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118276:56"/>he ſuſtaines by his gracious aſſiſtance, and inables them to bear what he layes upon them: the other he gives over to endleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; to the one he brings a pruning knife to lop and purge them; to the other the Axe of deſolation to cut them down and deſtroy them. And thus we ſee what theſe chaſtiſements are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are to conſider to what end they are, or why he doth chaſten us. The end why God doth chaſten his Children. is partly for his own glory, and partly for their good. For his own glory two wayes eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſhew how greatly he is diſpleaſed and offended with ſinne, inſomuch that he doth not ſpare it in his own Children. For this is moſt certain, that if man had never committed ſinne, he ſhould never have been ſubject unto any affliction; but as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned againſt God, then God by afflicting him, made manifeſt how he is diſpleaſed and offended by ſinne, becauſe, ſaith God unto <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou haſt eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat,</hi> Curſed is the earth for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the dayes of thy life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as there is nothing in the World but onely ſinne that diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, ſo there is nothing but ſinne that is diſpleaſing and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive unto him. And this is ſo offenſive, that at firſt when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpring up in Heaven among the <hi>Angels,</hi> God preſently pulled up this weede by the root, and caſt the Angels out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: afterwards when it began to take root in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> among our firſt Parents, God weeded it from thence, and thruſt them out of <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> afterwards again when it began to increaſe, and to ſpread it ſelf all over the earth God to cleanſe the earth from this pollution did ſend the deluge, and drowned all the world except eight perſons; and ſtill to ſhew how it doth diſpleaſe him, even thoſe whom he loves, he chaſtens for ſinne, and doth not ſpare it in his own Children.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon, why God doth afflict us for his own glory, is to make manifeſt his power in our weakneſs, that when we are ſufficiently humbled by affliction, and paſt all recovery of our ſelves, he might ſhew his power in our deliverance, and provoke us to thankfulneſs when he hath delivered us.</p>
            <p>Thus he ſuffered <hi>Daniel</hi> to be caſt among the Lions, the three Children to be thrown into a fiery furnace; and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be ſo hotly purſued by <hi>Pharoh;</hi> that they were faine to flie through
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118276:56"/>the read Sea with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that when they were delivered, they might aſcribe the glory thereof unto God, and ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David, This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes:</hi> And theſe are the reaſons which concern Gods glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God doth chaſten and correct us for our good. <hi>Si bonus eſt qui patitur, in bonum deſinit quodcunque patitur.</hi> If he be good that ſuffers, it is for his good whatſoever he ſuffers. For howſoever afflictions ſeem evill to us, yet God like a skilfull <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> that will make good uſe of poyſon, turnes them to the good and benefit of his Children, and that divers wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To withdraw us from the love of the World, and to draw us nearer to God; for when we are viſited with any affliction, we are more ready to ſeek unto God for help, as the ſick man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires unto the <hi>Phyſitian.</hi> While we live in health, and proſperity; we are more prone to forget God, as having leſſe feeling of the want of his help, and we commonly take ſuch a liking of this World, that we are loath to leave it; but when we are afflicted, then we ſeek unto God for help and comfort, which becauſe we cannot find in the World, we grow weary of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of a Souldier of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that having a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which was irkſome unto him, it made him wearie of his life; inſomuch, that he would adventure upon any danger, and there was no ſo deſperate a piece of ſervice, but he would alwayes be the foremoſt in it. The <hi>Generall</hi> much affecting him for his great valour, was at great expences to have him cured of his Diſeaſe; but when he had got him cured, looking that he ſhould be as valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and reſolute as he was before, he found him far otherwiſe, and unwilling to put himſelf into any danger; whereof when the <hi>Generall</hi> asked him the reaſon, he gave him this anſwer, <hi>That when his Body was diſeaſed, he was weary of it; but ſeeing that now it was whole and ſound, he was loth to looſe it.</hi> As it was with this Souldier, ſo God ſeeth it to be with many of us; when we are in adverſity, we grow weary of this life, and can ſay with <hi>Jonah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jonah.</hi> 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>It is better for me to die then to live:</hi> but when we are in proſperity, the caſe is altered; we take ſuch a liking of this preſent World, that we are loath to leave it; but can ſay with <hi>Peter, Maſter it is good for us to be here;</hi> and are of the ſame mind as the <hi>Cardinall</hi> was, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt he would not leave his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for his part in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> And therefore as a Nurſe, when ſhe would weane the Child from ſucking the dugge, will annoint her teates with ſome bitter thing;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118276:57"/>to the end, that the Child may begin to miſlike them: So God to withdraw us from the pleaſures of this World, ſends us afflictions to reclaime us from our pleaſures, and to make the ſame more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory unto us. For as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would never have thought of leaving <hi>Egypt,</hi> and coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> if they had not been afflicted in the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> So many will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the pleaſures of this life, untill they be diſtaſted thereof by affliction. And therefore God chaſtens and afflicts his Children, becauſe affliction is a meanes to weane them from the World, and to draw them unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Tentatio quaſi inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatio.</note> A ſecond Reaſon why God doth afflict them, is to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thoſe gifts and graces which lie hidden in them. For as ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the ſpring time, cauſe the budds to appear which before were not ſeene; ſo afflictions make manifeſt many virtues in Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which before lay hidden. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have ſacrificed his Sonne, he had not had that occaſion to have teſtified his obedience: and if <hi>Job</hi> had not been ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly afflicted as he was, he had not had occaſion to have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his patience. Many virtues lie hidden in the Children of God, while they are in proſperity; but when adverſity comes, then they break forth like ſtarres in the night, and do ſhew themſelves. I might alleage other Reaſons why God doth chaſten us, as to make us conformable to Chriſt our head, to ſhew us how weak we are of our ſelves, without Gods aſſiſtance, to ſtir us up to prayer, to teach us humility, and to exerciſe our patience; all which may hearten us in the time of affliction, becauſe it is for our good that God thus afflicts us. We are much dejected when we are afflicted, we count our afflictions to be long and grievous for the time; but the Apoſtle teacheth us to make another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. where he calles our afflictions <hi>both ſhort and light, our light affliction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</note> ſaith he, <hi>which is but for a moment.</hi> Some indeed are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted longer then other, yet their afflictions are but ſhort that continue longeſt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9.33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.20.</note> We read of one <hi>Acts</hi> 9. that was ſick of the Palſie, and kept his Bedde 8. years. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, of a Woman that was diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood for 12. years. St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us of a Woman that had a ſpirit of infirmity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11.</note> and was bowed together, and could in nowiſe lift up her ſelf for 18. years. St. <hi>John</hi> tells us of a Man that had been diſeaſed 38. years. The time no doubt ſeemed long unto theſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 5.5.</note> yet indeed our whole lifetime is but ſhort, but a ſpan long as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, and therefore our ſufferings cannot be long, which are all comprized in ſo ſhort
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118276:57"/>a time. For afflictions are as it were Gods ſpeedy Meſſengers, which he ſends to do his Meſſage or arrand unto us. Somtimes to tell us that we forget God, and therefore need be put in mind of him by being afflicted. Sometime to tell us that we are too proud, and therefore need affliction to be humbled by it: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to tell us that we are too much afflicted with the love of the World, and therefore need affliction to be weaned from it. Of theſe and the like arrands they are ſent unto us, and when they have done them, they are preſently gone like the Angels which were ſent over-night to <hi>Lot,</hi> and when they had done their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, went away the next morning. But though we ſuffered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for a long time, yet we might well count our ſufferings ſhort, in regard of that endleſs and infinite happineſs which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes our ſufferings. If our future happineſs were of no longer continuance then the afflictions we ſuffered; yet this might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, that our ſufferings come firſt, and our happineſs after, and that our happineſs is to come when our ſufferings are over: which may afford us more comfort in our greateſt ſufferings, then the wicked can find in their greateſt pleaſures. The wicked have their pleaſures firſt, they firſt injoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, wherein they can take the loſſe delight; when they conſider that after their pleaſures are paſt, their ſufferings are to come, which will eat up the pleaſures which they have formerly taken, as the ſeaven years of famine which followed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> did eat up and conſume the ſeaven years plenty which went before them.<note place="margin">

They are enemies to God, enemies to men, enemies to themſelves, and therefore can have no peace at all, either inward or outward, either at home or abroad, either with themſelves or with others.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe indeed there can be no peace, where there is no righteouſneſs. Therefore the Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 32. makes peace to be a fruit and effect of righteouſneſs. <hi>The work,</hi> ſaith he,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118276:58"/>

                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 32.17.</note>

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.</note> 
               <hi>and peace have kiſſed each other;</hi> where righteouſneſs and peace as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, are propounded by the Prophet as two loving Friends, who ſo agree together, as that he who oppoſeth himſelf againſt the one, muſt needes oppoſe himſelf againſt the other, and ſo can never injoy peace, who regards not righteouſneſs. But as <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jehuram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. when he askt <hi>Jehu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.22</note> Is it peace? what peace, ſaith <hi>Jehu,</hi> ſo long as the whoredoms of thy Mother <hi>Ieſabell,</hi> and her witch-crafts are ſo many? ſo while the wicked do multiply their ſinnes, what peace can they have? what peace either with God, who hates all thoſe that work wickedneſs; or what peace with the Creatures, who are alwayes ready to revenge Gods quarrel againſt his adverſaries; or what peace with men, whether they be the godly or the wicked like themſelves, while they hate the godly, and the godly them, as being Gods enemies; and the wicked again hate them, as knowing them to be ſuch, as onely like them while they ſerve their turns, and will be as ready to do them wrong, if it be for their advantage: And what peace again can they have with themſelves, while they have one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them that beares witneſs againſt them, even their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>Firſt, They can have no peace with God, no more then a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can have peace with his Prince againſt whom he rebels. For the wicked are Rebels againſt God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.30.</note> their diſobedience in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is called Rebellion, to ſhew that while they diſobey Gods Lawes, he accounts them no better then Rebels and Traytors, as if they were at defiance with him, and up in Armes againſt him. As indeed they are, becauſe they both ſerve his Enemy the Devill, and make no account of diſobeying God, ſo they may ſatisfie their own will and pleaſure. For look what ſinnes they delight in, they wholly devote themſelves thereunto, giving them the chief place in their affection, and ſetting them up in Gods roome. So the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picure makes his belly his God, the ambitious man makes honour his God, the voluptuous liver makes pleaſure his God, and the covetous miſer makes mony his God, becauſe they perform that ſervice unto them which they owe unto God; they love their pleaſures, preferments and profits, more then they love God, they obey them more then they obey God, they fear more to loſe them then to loſe the ſavour of God; and they put more truſt and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118276:59"/>confidence in them then they put in God. Therefore as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not God, ſo he regards not them, but when they ſeem to offer him their ſervice, he rejects the ſame. So that even their very prayers which they keep for their laſt refuge, and whereby they think to curry favour with God in their diſtreſſe and affliction; are abominable unto him.</p>
            <p>For ſo we ſee <hi>Proverbs</hi> 28.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 38.9.</note> 
               <hi>He that turnes away his care from hearing the law, even his prayer ſhall be abomination.</hi> Which is to be underſtood not only of ſuch as refuſe to hear it, but likewiſe of ſuch as refuſe to obey it, that though they tread in his courts, and come to Church, though they hear his word, and offer him their prayers yet becauſe they are ſuch as hate to be reformed, and will not leave their ſins, God abhors all their ſervice, and will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plague them for praying unto him, then accept their prayers. For ſo long as they refuſe to obey his lawes, he holds them for rebels, and profeſſeth himſelf an enemy to them as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. So that the wicked can have no peace with God, becauſe they are his enemies, and he theirs, only the godly have this peace, <hi>as being aſſured by faith that they are reconciled unto God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God through. Chriſt our Lord.</hi> They therefore that would be at peace with God, they muſt have faith, for like as our faith is, ſo is our peace, a true ſaith, a true peace, an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall faith, an hypocriticall peace, a temporary faith, a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry peace: and look where there is a weak or no faith, there is likewiſe a weak or no peace. And ſo the wicked having no faith, to believe that God is reconciled unto them, they cannot have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peace with God, but ſtill look upon him as upon an angry Judge, and expect nothing from him but wrath and vengeance for their ſin and wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the wicked have no peace with God, ſo likewiſe they have no peace with the creatures, which are at enmity with them that are Gods enemies. Therefore we ſee how all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the greateſt to the leaſt, have oppoſed themſelves againſt the wicked, and have armed themſelves againſt thoſe that have diſobeyed God. Therefore God is called the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> as having all creatures as ſouldiers under him, and ready, as it were, in battail-aray, to fight againſt them, that do not ſerve him. If God be offended with the old World for their ſins, he need not march againſt them in his own perſon, but the Windows of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118276:59"/>the Springs of the earth, will conſpire together, to ſend forth their water to overwhelm them. For all the creatures both in heaven and earth do take Gods part to execute vengeance upon his adverſaries. <hi>The Angels deſtroyed the Army of blaſphemous Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib, ſlew the firſt-born of Egypt, and ſmote Herod.</hi>

Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Serpents ſtung the Iſraelites that murmured. Beares ſlew the children that derided the Prophet; a Lyon the Prophet that diſobeyed the Lord; the dogges did eat Jezabell, and the wormes Herod.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authours are full of the like examples, how the creatures have been enemies unto the wicked. It is very memorable which they report of <hi>Ibicus</hi> the Poet, That being robbed by ſome ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, and haled through a field, and murdered by them, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none by, while they were thus haling him, but a company of Cranes flying over the field, he cried to the Cranes, you Cranes ſhall bear witneſſe what they do unto me. The murderers were not known for a long time, but at laſt there being a great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity kept in the ſame field, whereat two of the murderers of <hi>Ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> were preſent, ſuddenly a great noiſe of Cranes was heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the field, Heark, ſaith one of the murderers to his fellow, theſe are the witneſſes which <hi>Ibicus</hi> ſaid ſhould diſcloſe his death; which one over-hearing, and knowing that <hi>Ibicus</hi> had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, began to ſuſpect them, and telling the Magiſtrate what he had heard, they were ſent for and examined, and confeſſed the fact, and were condemned, and executed. It were endleſſe to inſtance in all the particulars, how the creatures have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the wicked to revenge the Lords quarrels, and to bring them to confuſion that have refuſed to ſerve him. So we read of <hi>Ha to Bonoſus</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who was a great enemy to the poor, and was wont to call them miſe and vermine, that when any poor came to him for relief in a dear year, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to go into a barn, pretending that he would ſend them relief thither, but when they were there, he ſhut up the doors, and ſet the barn on fire, and ſo burnt them all to death to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but afterwards by the juſt judgement of God he was haunted and aſſaulted, and purſued by miſe, which could not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118276:60"/>by any means be kept from him, but ſwam after him through the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> and there devoured him. So we read of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> that proud inſolent Pope, who made the Emperour ſtoop, and hold his ſtirrop, how he was afterwards ſtifled, and choaked by a gnat: God ſhewing by theſe and the like examples, that he hath all creatures at his beck and command to do him ſervice and that he can pull down the pride of the greateſt even by the baſeſt creatures. The creatures were made for the ſervice of man, as man was made for the ſervice of God, God giving man ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the creatures, and reſtoring to himſelf the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over man; but becauſe that man rebelled againſt God, the creatures began to rebell againſt man, God making the creatures to become our enemies that were our ſervants, becauſe we that were made to be his ſervants, were become his enemies. Therefore though the creatures be at enmity with the wicked, yet they are at peace with the godly,<note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, the wicked have no peace with men. Therefore it is ſaid here in the former <hi>verſe, The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters do caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> For the wicked are turbulent of their own nature, but if they be ſtirred or moved never ſo little, they begin like the ſea when it is moved with winds to ſwell and foam, and diſgorge their malice againſt them that offend them.

They are eaſily drawn upon any light occaſion to fall out with their neighbours, and not eaſily pacified, but hard to be reconciled where they have taken offence. Nay, they are ſo far from either making or taking peace, that they delight to ſow diſcord and diſſention among others, like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> who to make variance between Chriſt and his Diſciples, ſometimes accuſed the diſciples to Chriſt,<note place="margin">

But the godly on the contrary, who are called by our Saviour, <hi>The Sons of peace, they are peace-makers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>labouring to unite and reconcile thoſe whom they ſee at variance.</hi> So we read of <hi>Moniſtia,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> Mother, that when ſhe heard there was variance between any of her neighbours, ſhe would firſt go to one of them, and relate unto her ſome good of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and having brought her to acknowledge it to be true, and wonne her to a better liking of her; then ſhe would go to the other, and tell her that ſhe had heard, there was ſome diſcontent between her and ſuch a neighbour, but hoped it was not true, becauſe ſhe had lately been in her company, and heard her ſpeak very well of her, and ſo by relating ſome good between them, ſhe would breed a better liking of one to the other. Thus the godly ſeek to reconcile thoſe whom they ſee at odds. Nay, if there happens any breach between themſelves, and others, they will ſeek to be reconciled, though it be to their own diſadvantage. So did <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.8.9.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. who when there fell a ſtrife between his ſervants &amp; <hi>Lots,</hi> he came unto <hi>Lot, Let</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, between thee and me, neither between my heard-men and thine, for we are brethren: Is not the whole land before thee? if thou wilt take the left hand, I will go to the right, or if thou wilt go to the right hand, I will take the left.</hi> Where you ſee how deſirous he was of peace. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> were a better man then <hi>Lot,</hi> yet he ſtood not upon that, he ſtayed not till <hi>Lot</hi> would come unto him, but he went unto <hi>Lot,</hi> and was the firſt that ſought reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and rather then he would not have reconcilement between them, he offers him his choiſe of the whole land, and ſo was content to purchaſe peace, though it were to his own loſſe and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118276:61"/>hinderance. For the godly who are the children of God, do imitate God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6.</note> who is called in the Scripture <hi>the God of peace,</hi> and therefore they are peace-makers, both ſeeking to unite and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile others that are at diſſention, and deſiring if it were poſſible, and as much as lieth in them, <hi>to have peace with all men:</hi> whereas for the wicked, becauſe they do not delight in peace, it is far from them: and have not either any peace with God, nor peace with the creatures, nor peace with men.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As they have no peace abroad ſo none at home, as they have no peace with others, ſo none with themſelves. They carry within them a guilty conſcience which doth accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, and will not ſuffer them to be at peace. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience indeed doth not always trouble them, but then when it doth not, their caſe is more deſperate. For like as it is in the ſickneſſe of the body, vvhen the pulſe doth not beat, the body is in a more dangerous eſtate; ſo it is likevviſe in the ſickneſſe of the ſoul: When the conſcience doth not beat and check them for ſin, their caſe is more dangerous, becauſe it is a ſigne, <hi>that their conſcience is ſeared</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>with a hot-iron;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</note> and that their cuſtom of ſinning doth take avvay from them the ſenſe of ſin, and makes them paſt feeling. But when ſickneſſe or any other croſſe or affliction is laid upon them, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is wakened again, then it begins to torment them afreſh and will ſo terrifie and affright them with the ſight of their ſins, that they ſhall finde no reſt. Though the wicked had all the wealth in the world, and wanted nothing that their hearts could deſire for their outward eſtate, yet as long as their ſins are a wound to their ſouls, and a torment to their conſcience, they can never have any peace in themſelves. For this peace is only wrought by faith in Chriſt, whereby a man believes that Chriſt hath made a full ſatisfaction to God for all his ſins, and therefore that they ſhall not be laid to his charge, which faith, becauſe the wicked have not, nor ever can have, while they continue in their ſins, they cannot have this peace, and wanting this peace, they want the greateſt bleſſing that is. For he that hath this peace, though he have nothing beſides, yet he wants not any thing, and he that wants this peace, though he have every thing elſe, yet indeed he hath nothing. <hi>This peace is a continuall feaſt to the godly,</hi> it makes them to fare (as it is ſaid of the rich man in the Goſpel)<hi>every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly.</hi> And this peace is the fruit of our peace with God, which Chriſt the Prince of peace, bath purchaſed for us, and bequeathed

The peace which the World gives, is falſe and uncertaine and doth oftten deceive us; but this is a true and certaine peace which never fails us; the peace which the world gives is onely outward, and onely affords us externall content, but this peace extends to the quieting of the conſcience the peace which the world gives is only tranſitory as the world is, but this is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent as the giver of it; for this is one of the chief of his gifts whoſe gifts you know are without repentance; And therefore he gives it onely to the godly and not to the wicked.</p>
            <p>We have heard then, the thing that is proclaimed, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can have no peace, no peace with God, no peace with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no peace with men, no peace with themſelves, their vvant of the firſt, their want of peace with God being the cauſe that they want the reſt and have no peace with others.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 13.</note> When therefore we ſee Gods wrath break forth againſt any place, as ye know he hath many wayes revealed of late againſt this Land, by that heavy viſitation of Plague and Peſtilence, whereby he ſwept away ſo many thouſands, by hot burning-Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and other grievous diſeaſes in the moſt places, by unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of weather and immoderate ſhowers, by ſuffering the enemy to give us the foile, and to have the better of us, and many other wayes; we may well be aſſured that our ſins have provoked him, and if we repent not, theſe are but the fore-runners of greater judgements. God is not eaſily provoked to anger, but many times beares a long time with ſinners, that by his forbearing them he might draw them to repentance; but if they go on, he will more and more manifeſt his wrath againſt them; which as their ſinnes increaſe growes further and further, like fire which firſt takes hold
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118276:62"/>of one houſe and then goes to another. He powres not out his whole Viall of his wrath at once but by degrees, the former judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments making way for the latter; the leſſe for the greater; firſt making ſome ſmart that others may amend; which if they do not, his wrath will break forth upon them altogether. So we ſee he dealt with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> God brought ſundry plagues upon him and his people; yet the latter were more fearfull and grievous then the former, and when none of thoſe judgements which he had powred upon them would make them take warning, in the end he drowned them all in the Red-Sea together. So when our Saviour <hi>Math.</hi> 24 had forthtold many judgements that ſhould come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for their contempt of the Goſpel, and for their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and rejecting of grace when it was offered unto them, he adds this, That <hi>the end is not yet, and that all theſe are but the beginnings of ſorrows:</hi> as they found afterwards by wofull experience; For in the end, vvhen he had many wayes plagued them before, and they were ne're the better, he powr'd out his wrath in full meaſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and brought utter deſolation upon them all. They might have underſtood by the former puniſhments (which were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their ſorrowes) that there were greater coming except they prevented them; as when a man ſees the ſmoke breaking out of the houſe, he may know there is ſire, which will break forth into a flame if it be not looked to in time: And ſo may we, we may underſtand by Gods former judgements, that there are greater hanging over our heads, except we prevent them by unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Let every one therefore in the feare of God, turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by true humiliation; aſſuring our ſelves, that as long as we continue impenitent in our ſinnes, we make God our enemy, and ſo can have no peace.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the thing that is here proclaimed, <hi>That there is no peace to the wicked.</hi> I come now briefly to the perſon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it, the Prophet from the mouth of the Lord, <hi>Thre is no peace to the Wicked ſaith my God.</hi>

That Miniſters are to deliver nothing but the Word of God, that they may be able to ſay as the Prophet here ſaith, <hi>ſaith my God,</hi> And as St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which I delivered unto you, I received from the Lord.

            <p>Secondly, This ſerves to inſtruct the hearers, that they muſt make account that they hear the Lord while they hear his Meſſengers. Therefore it is that the faithfull ſay <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. <hi>Come let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways,</hi> as making account that they were taught by God, while they were taught by his Miniſters. <hi>He</hi> ſaith our Saviour,<note place="margin">

Now Miniſters are as it were Chriſts Heralds, to proclaime and make known his will unto us; which while they Proclaime, we muſt make account that we hear him while we hear them. And therefore as this ſerves to ſhew their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who make the leſſe account of hearing the Word, becauſe they are but men like themſelves that deliver it: ſo it likewiſe ſerves to reprove thoſe who are offended with Miniſters when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their ſinnes. For what reaſon hath any man to be offended with the Meſſenger for the Meſſage lie brings, ſeeing he ſpeaks not in his own name but in his that ſent him. and it is not his, but his Lords Meſſage.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But ſome man may ſay, Indeed the Apoſtle ſaith thus, but how doth he prove it? He ſaith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>that the Scriptures are inſpired of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> but how doth he prove it? When <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that great profound Philoſopher, ſaw the books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> and read what he wrote about the Creation of the world, he miſliked his Books, becauſe he proved not that which he wrote. <hi>Hic omnia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, nihil probat,</hi> This man ſaith he, ſaith every thing, but he proyes nothing: But we are to remember, that though we may doubt of that which men ſay, becauſe all men are lyars as the Scripture ſaith, and ſo need proofs to conſume their ſayings; yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118276:63"/>being the Word of God, is of it ſelf ſufficient to credit and need not any proof for the confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> have a ſaying, that the Law doth not need any fortification, in regard that God was the Authour of it: and ſo God being the Authour of the whole Scripture, it needs no fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or proof to ſtrengthen it; but whatſoever we find written therein, we need make no queſtion of the truth thereof, but are bound to believe it.</p>
            <p>True may ſome ſay, if we were aſſured that the Scriptures are the Word of God, &amp; that God &amp; not man was the Author of them, then we need make no queſtion of the truth of thoſe things which we find therein; But how ſhall we know them to be Gods word, and that no other was the Authour of them? Which becauſe it is the ſumme of that which the Apoſtle delivers in theſe words, I purpoſe briefly to handle this queſtion, <hi>How a man may know and be fully aſſured, that the Scriptures muſt needs be the word of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which queſtion, there is a great controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They ſay, <hi>that the onely Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, is ſufficient to perſwade us that the Scripture is the Word of God; and that if it were not for the Teſtimony of the Church, we could not give any credit to it.</hi> We ſay, <hi>that the Scripture is known to be Gods Word, by the inward Teſtimony of Gods Spirit; and that without this Teſtimony to perſwade us hereunto, the teſtimony of the Church and of all other whatſoever, is inſufficient.</hi>

               </note> Our faith will ſtagger, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> if the authority of the Scripture ſtand not firme. But how can the authority of the Scripture ſtand firme, if it be built onely upon ſo weak a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the teſtimony of man; For the Church is ſubject to errour, both in doctrine and manners; and therefore this teſtimony may deceive us: But we require an infallible proof for the certainty of the Scriptures. They ſay that the Teſtimony of the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and when we wil have them to prove it, they prove it thus, becauſe it is the pillar and ground of truth,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> as the Scripture tells us. Thus if a man doubt of the authority of the Scripture, to prove it they ſend him to the teſtimony of the Church; and while he doubts of the truth of the teſtimony of the Church, to prove it, they ſend him back again to the Scripture. But if the Church be ſufficient to perſwade a man that the Scriptures are the word of God, how comes it to paſſe that <hi>Turks</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſidels,</hi> who have often heard this teſtimony of the Church, are not yet perſwaded of the truth of the Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:118276:64"/>
            <p>How many thouſands of <hi>Jewes</hi> are now living in <hi>Italie,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in <hi>Rome,</hi> who deny the Goſpel, and are not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Chriſt is come? If the onely Teſtimony of the Church be ſufficient, why make they not proof thereof upon them, that the World may ſee the virtue and efficacy of it: But we know experience tells them daily to their faces, that they cannot do it; and if you ask them the reaſon, they can give none but this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the blindneſs and unbelief of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> why therefore ſay we, that that which is able to aſſure a man, that the Scripture is Gods word, muſt be able to illuminate his underſtanding, and to give him faith that he may believe it, but this is onely the work of Gods ſpirit. There is nothing more ordinary among the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> then when they delivered Gods vvord to the People, to tell the People that it was Gods vvord which they delivered. <hi>Heare the word of the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> (1.10.) <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremie</hi> (1.4.) and thus every one of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> from the firſt to the laſt, do teſtifie that they delivered the vvord of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.1.</note> But who hath believed our report, ſaith <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſo that where there was one that believed it, there were many that did not: and therefore if neither the vvord it ſelf, nor the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Prophets</hi> concerning the vvord, could perſwade them that it was the vvord of God, much leſſe is the teſtimony of the Church ſufficient, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Phylippi, Acts</hi> 16. there were many that heard him; but it is ſaid there of <hi>Liddia,</hi> onely that God opened her heart, ſo that ſhe attended unto that which he ſpake:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14.</note> now if ſhe could not ſo much as attend unto thoſe things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivered, unleſſe that God had firſt opened her heart; much leſſe could ſhe have believed, that that which he ſpake was the vvord of God, but by the inward operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods ſpirit:</p>
            <p>The Word is ſometimes called a light, becauſe it is lightſome in it ſelf as the Sunne, but as the Sunne though it be never ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, yet it cannot be diſcerned by thoſe that are blind: So the Word, though in it ſelf it be never ſo glorious, yet it is not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to us till our hearts be opened. The Word is ſometime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſeed, becauſe it is fruitfull like the ſeed that is ſowen; but as the ſeed which is ſowen cannot bring forth increaſe, but by the influence and virtue which it receiveth from Heaven; no more is the word fruitfull and effectual in us, till God by his ſpirit give a bleſſing unto it. The word is not unlike the poole in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:118276:64"/>whereof there is mention <hi>John</hi> 5. The poole though it cured all outward Diſeaſes, yet it had not this virtue, but then onely when the <hi>Angell</hi> did ſtir the waters: the word though it be the means to cure our inward infirmities, yet it cannot do it but onely by the motion of Gods ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now the firſt Diſeaſe which is to be cured is out ſpiritual blindnſs, whereby we are ignorant of Gods will, his vvill is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently revealed in his vvord but we cannot diſcerne it to be his word till God by his ſpirit do inlighten our underſtanding. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. vve have received the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13.</note> that we might know the things that are given us of God: and preſently after in the ſame Chapter, but the natural man, ſaith he, perceives not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him, neither can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned.</p>
            <p>Now leaſt we ſhould imagine, that becauſe we are aſſured of the truth of Gods vvord, onely by the teſtimony of Gods ſpirit, that therefore till his ſpirit do work faith in our hearts, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, and the hearing of the word is but va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n and needleſs: we are to underſtand, that Gods ſpirit doth ordinarily beget faith in the godly by theſe outward meanes.</p>
            <p>For firſt, the Teſtimony of the Church concerning the vvord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to come with the reſt to hear it, and while we are diligent and attentive in hearing it, Gods ſpirit doth ordinarily beget faith in our hearts, whereby we believe it; and when faith hath once taken root in our hearts, then we are ſo fully reſolved of the truth of the Scriptures, that all thoſe arguments whereof before we made but light account, are now like infallible demonſtrations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. For then we ſee plainly how neceſſary it was, that God ſhould reveal his vvill unto us; and that if he have not revealed it in the Scripture, he hath revealed it no where. But that it is his will which he hath revealed in his vvord, theſe Reaſons will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that the majeſty of Gods ſpirit doth appear in every part of the Scripture, wherein there is nothing that ſavours of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom; but every thing therein is heavenly and divine, for if we conſider the matter thereof, it far exceeds all humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For who could tell us of the Creation of the vvorld, and the fall of <hi>Angels?</hi> of the corruption of the whole nature of man, through the tranſgreſſion and diſobedience of our firſt Parents?
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118276:65"/>of the redemption of the vvorld by the coming of the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> of the rewards of the faithfull in the life to come, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners? Theſe things and many other which the Scripture reveals, do ſo far go beyond the capacity of man, that had not God revealed them in his word, they could never have been known.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we conſider who penned the Scripture, we ſhall find them for the moſt part to be ſimple men, and therefore of themſelves not capable of thoſe heavenly myſteries which they have revealed in their vvritings.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16.18.</note> They were not learned, and yet they foreſaw things to come, as if they were preſent, and foretold many things which many hundred years after did come to paſſe. They were not eloquent, and yet more powerfull in moving the affections, then <hi>Tullie, Demoſthenes,</hi> and all the Rhetoricians in the vvorld beſides. They lived not together, but in divers ages and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and yet they agree ſo perfectly without the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as if they had had but one mind among them. In a word,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.51. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.3.6: <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.9.</note> they were not as other men given over to ſin, but lived more uprightly then the moſt in their times, and yet they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred their own ſins and infirmities, to remain as it were upon the file unto all Poſterities, which had they been led by humane wiſdom, they would never have done. All which ſhewes, that howſoever the Scriptures were written here by men, yet they were indicted by God in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we conſider the perfection of the Law which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> we ſhall ſee that none but God could be the Authour of it. For there is not any good either outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which we are bound to perform to God or man, but it is there commanded, nor any evil from which we are to abſtain, but it is there prohibited: all which to be comprized in ſo few words, farre exceeds the invention of men or Angels. Mens Lawes how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they fill many large Volums, yet they are ſtill imperfect, and daily want ſomething to be added unto them, which when they were made was not thought upon: Sometimes again they muſt have ſomething detracted, that being thought convenient for the time when the Law was made, which afterwards is found to be inconvenient, in regard that mens conditions do ſo often change. So that as it is in the fable, when the Moon upon a time begged a new Coat of her mother: her Mother replied, that it was impoſſible to make her a Coat which would be fit for her, by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118276:65"/>reaſon that her ſhape did ſo often alter, as being now in the full, now in the wane, one while in one form, and ſtrait in another: So it is impoſſible for men or Angels to make Lawes, which without adding or detracting ſhould ſerve for all perſons and all ages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their manners and conditions do ſo often change. But this Law which we find recorded in the Scripture, is ſo abſolute and perfect, that it ſerves for all perſons, in all places and all ages, and yet needes nothing to be added or detracted. All other Lawes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no further then to mens ſayings or doings, their words and their actions, and take hold of them onely if they be not anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Law, but for the thoughts of mens hearts they do not inflict any penalty upon them, but do leave them free. The <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> ſay, <hi>Cogitationis paenam in foro noſtro nemo luat,</hi> let no man be puniſht in our Court for a thought. But this Law doth ſearch into the ſecrets of the heart, not only reſtraining our actual ſins, but our ſinfull thoughts, even our very firſt motions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſin, though we do not yield our conſent thereunto, to put the ſame in execution.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. that he had not known concupiſcence to be a ſinne, if the Law had not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet. For like as the Sunſhine doth make us to ſee the leaſt atomes or moaths, which if it were not for the bright light of the Sunne, we could not diſcerne: So this bright light of the Law diſcovers the leaſt and moſt ſecret ſins, which without this Law we could not have known. All other Lawes becauſe they cannot judge of the heart, do require no more then outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and judge well of him that lives according to the Law for his outward Carriage. But this Law which as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> requires both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward obedience, and judgeth not him to be a good man, who frames himſelf outwardly to the obſerving of the Law, but not inwardly. For as a man is not to be counted well and in good health, though his hands and feete, and all the reſt of his outward parts be ſound and perfect, if his lungs or any other of his inward parts be unſound and diſeaſed. So this Law doth not count him to be a good man, though his outward actions ſeem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good, if his inward parts, his thoughts and affections be ill and diſordered. In a word, all other Lawes propound no other but temporall rewards to thoſe that obſerve them, and temporall puniſhments to ſuch as trangreſs them: but the rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments which this Law propounds, are both corporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118276:66"/>temporal and eternall, both in this World, and the World to come. By all which it is plain, that this Law which we find recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Scripture, is in many reſpects more abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then all the flowers which men have invented, and therefore that God and no other could be the Authour of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If we conſider what effects the Scriptures work in the hearers and readers of them, it will confirm our faith in this point, that they muſt needes have God for their Authour, and not man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which is contained in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and contrary to fleſh and bloud, and croſſes our nature. We naturally deſire to live in peace and proſperity, we affect honour and advancement, eaſe, riches, pleaſures, liberty and the like; which if the <hi>Scripture</hi> had promiſed, it would in all likelihood have been a motive to make men the more to affect and imbrace it. But we ſee the <hi>Scripture</hi> promiſes the quite contrary to theſe, croſſes and troubles, perſecution and hatred for the Goſpels ſake, and yet the ſound thereof is gone through the World, and thouſands do daily more and more affect it. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> would perſwade the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> to follow him in the Warres, he made them this promiſe, whoſoever, ſaith <hi>Cyrus,</hi> will be my followers, if they be foot-men I will give them Horſes; if they be Horſe-men I will give them Chariots; if they have Houſes and Tenements of their own, I wil give them Villages; and if they have Villages, I vvill make them Lords of Townes and Cities; and for gold and ſilver, I vvill heap it unto them by vveight and by meaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> allured them by his fair promiſes, as the likelieſt meanes to vvinne their affections.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23.</note> But vvhat ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel to his followers? <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye will be my Diſciples, ye muſt daily take up my Croſſe upon you;</hi> you muſt leave your Parents, Wives, Children and Friends, and all you have to follow me, you muſt be reviled and perſecuted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22.</note> and hated of all men for my names ſake.</p>
            <p>Now this ye know, ſhould rather hinder men when they read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from imbracing the Goſpel, and becoming <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> yet ſo effectual are the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> through the operation of the ſpirit in thoſe that read or hear them, that nothing can hinder them from imbracing the ſame, which is an evident proof that no other but God could be the Authour thereof.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:118276:66"/>
            <p>Laſtly, if we conſider the long continuance, and antiquity of the Scripture, how God in all ages hath miraculouſly preſerved it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the malice of Satan, and all thoſe Tyrants, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuters, who have oppoſed themſelves againſt it, we may plainly ſee that it is the word of God. When the Jewes would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Preaching of the Apoſtles <hi>Acts</hi> 5.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 5.38.39.</note> it was <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to let them alone, and he gave this reaſon, for ſaith he, <hi>if it be of men it will come to nought, but if it be of God ye cannot deſtroy it.</hi> All falſe Religions which have had their beginning and original from man, have continued for a time and have afterwards va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't: but the true Religion which the Scripture containes, hath continued without change in all ages, nay the more it hath been oppoſed the more it hath flouriſh't, God having ordain'd that the Perſecution of thoſe that profeſſe the Goſple vvhich in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood vvould have been a meanes to have rooted it out, ſhould make men the more to affect and imbrace it. Hiſtories are full of examples to this purpoſe, I will onely name one, and that out of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> when Chriſtianity began to increaſe in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the King being an enemie to the true Religion, ſought by all meanes to root it out of his Kingdome. And firſt he impoſed ſo grievous taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chriſtians, that many thereby were brought into Poverty. And ſeing that the number ſtill increaſed more, and that they would not leave their Religion for the loſſe of their goods, he threatned them in the end with the loſs of their lives. Some few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted for feare of Torment, but the number of profeſſers did daily increaſe, though they daily were Martyr'd. Amongſt the reſt, <hi>Simeon</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Seleucia</hi> vvas apprehended, and becauſe he perſiſted in the profeſſion of the Goſpel the King ſent him to Priſon. And as he was going, <hi>Vſtazares</hi> one of the Kings chiefe Officers about his houſe (vvho had been a Chriſtian but for feare of torment had renounced his <hi>Religion</hi>) met the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the way and offered to ſalute him, but the <hi>Biſhop</hi> turned away from him as from an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and would not vouchſafe to look at him;</p>
            <p>Oh wo is me: ſaith <hi>Vſtazares,</hi> what favour can I look for at Gods hands, whom I have denied, when in regard of my apoſtacy, my familiar friend will not vouchſafe me a word? And thus mourning and lamenting he ran to the King, and openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf a Chriſtian, and added further, that he would never recant the ſecond time whatſoever became of him. The King
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:118276:67"/>commanded that he ſhould be beheaded at ſuch a time, and when the time came, <hi>Vſtazares</hi> ſent this meſſage to the King, to deſire him that for all the faithfull ſervice which he had ever done him, he would grant him this favour, that while he was led to the place where he ſhould be beheaded, a Herald or Crier might go before him, and make proclamation, that <hi>Vſtazares</hi> was to ſuffer, not for any treaſon or evill that he had committed, but only becauſe that he was a Chriſtian. The King granted his ſuit, as thinking that this would be a means to terrifie others, when they ſhould hear that the King would not ſpare, no not thoſe who were his chief Officers, if they profeſſed themſelves Chriſtians. This in all likelihood ſhould have been a means to make others revolt, but this made them to be far more couragious and reſolute. Some imbracing the block where they were to be beheaded, as if their beheading had been their coronation: others running with ſuch alacrity to the ſtake where they were to be burnt, as if the very flames which they were to enter into, had been the Gates of Heaven: <hi>The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the faithfull in all ages, being the whetſtone of faith,</hi> as Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> calls it, which makes the godly that are perſecuted the more willing to ſuffer, and the perſecutours when they ſee they cannot prevail, the more willing to give over. In ſo much that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> a grievous perſecutour, when he had uſed all the means that ever he could for the utter aboliſhing of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an profeſſion, when he had ſent out his Edicts for the burning of the Scriptures, for the torturing of Chriſtians, and putting down their Churches, and ſaw in the end that he could prevail nothing, for very ſpight and anger he gave over his Kingdom. I might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew you this, by the miſerable ends of all thoſe, who have profeſſed themſelves enemies unto the profeſſours of that Doctrine which the Scriptures teach. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the firſt perſecutour of the Church that ever was, <hi>was overwhelmed in the red-ſea with all his hoſt.

For firſt, the miracles which they wrought, were not wrought by their own power, but by the power of God, God uſing them as his inſtruments to work thoſe miracles. Therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine, Sancti non propria virtute miracula fecerunt, ſed deo in illis operante.</hi> Thoſe holy men did not work miracles by their own power and virtue, but by the power of God that wrought ſo them.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.8.</note> and he proves it in the words following by an excellent reaſon, <hi>For I am a man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>under authority, and have ſouldiers under me, and I ſay to this man, go, and he goes, and to another, come, and he comes, and to my ſervant, do this, and he doeth it.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If I can do this by my authority, then what canſt thou do? I am a man, and thou art God, I am under the authority of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but thou art Lord over all; I have ſouldiers and ſervants at my command, to do as I will them; Sickneſſe is thy ſouldier, and health is thy ſervant, and thou mayeſt command them; Say but thou to the palſie, go, and it will be gon; ſay thou to health, come, and it will come: and what thou willeſt them to do, they will do the ſame. Therefore in the Goſpell, we ſee how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded when he wrought any miracle. So when he raiſed the young man to life, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.14. <hi>Young man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſay unto

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.42.</note> So to the blind man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Receive thy ſight.</hi> And thus he wrought miracles by his Word and Command which others did not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though others have wrought ſome miracles, yet Chriſt hath wrought more then they all together. Some have cured the lame, but have not reſtored the blind; ſome have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſick, but have not raiſed the dead; ſome have done one cure, but not another, but Chriſt did all: <hi>Healing</hi> as we ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>all manner of diſeaſes among the people,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We read in the Scripture of a two-fold blindneſſe, the one outward, the other inward; the one corporall, the other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; the one of the body, the other of the ſoul. Chriſt cured many that were outwardly blind, whereof ſome were ſuch as had loſt their ſight, and could have ſeen before, and ſome that were born blind, and could never ſee at all, as the blind man that we read of <hi>John</hi> 9. the like cure whereof was never done by any but by Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 9.32.</note> ſince the World began. The blindneſſe of the body is very grievous. For that which the Sun is to the world, the eye is to the body, which being void of ſight, remains in a perpetuall night of darkneſſe. A man would count it a very grievous puniſhment to be kept in darkneſſe, but for a twelve-moneth together, where he might ſee no light. How grievous then muſt it needs be to them, who for want of their ſight do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in darkneſſe, and ſee no light for their whole life time? Truly ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.7. <hi>the light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is, for the eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> Therefore we read of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which are near to the Pole, where the night continues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers monthes together, and the Sun doth not ſhew himſelfe all the while, that the Inhabitants at the end of ſo long a night, at ſuch a time as the Sun is wont to appear, and bring the day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they get up to the top of their higheſt mountains, as ſtriving to have the firſt view of the Sun, which as ſoon as they ſee, they crie out for joy, <hi>Behold the Sun, the Sun appears, and they put on their beſt apparell, and feaſt one another,</hi> So welcome is the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:118276:70"/>light of the Sun among them, when they have wanted it long. For darkneſſe, ye know, is moſt uncomfortable: therefore though God ſent darkneſſe as a plague among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.22.23.</note> yet his people had light in all their dwellings. And therefore as hell is ſhadowed forth in the Scripture by the name of <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> to expreſſe the uncomfortableneſſe and horrour of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.12.</note> ſo heaven is illuſtrated by the name of <hi>light,</hi> to expreſſe the great comfort we ſhall finde in it; yet they which are in darkneſſe, and have not the light of the Sun among them, may have fire and candle, and other helps, to give them light, and to take away darkneſſe; but they who are blind, are always in the dark, and have no help againſt it. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable a thing it is to a man to want his ſight. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, whereas it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 25.8. <hi>That he gave up the Ghoſt, and died a good old age, and old man and full of years, and was gathered unto his people:</hi> It is only ſaid of <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 35.29. <hi>That Iſaac gave up the Ghoſt, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old, and full of dayes.</hi> It is not ſaid of him, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, That he died in a good old age:</hi> but this clauſe is omitted in the death of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as Divines obſerve; and they give this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe Iſaac's old age, by reaſon of his blindneſſe, could not be ſo good and comfortable unto him.</hi> For they want many comforts which others have, who do want their ſight. Therefore when our Saviour askt the blind man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.41.</note> 
               <hi>What he would have him to do for him,</hi> he preſently anſwered, <hi>Lord, that I may receive my ſight?</hi> as being more deſirous to have his ſight then any thing beſides.</p>
            <p>It is a grievous thing for a man to want his ſmelling or taſting, or any of his ſences, or his hands or feet, or any of his limbs, but far more grievous to want his eyes, becauſe the eye is the guide of the whole body, and directs every part and member of it, without which the tongue knows not before whom it ſpeaks, the hand knows not what it is it takes, the foot knows not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goes; but the tongue will erre, the hand will miſtake, and the foot will ſtumble, vvhere there is not an eye to vvatch over all, and to preſerve them from danger. Therefore God hath placed the eyes in the head, vvhere they may look to the whole body, becauſe every part hath uſe of the ſight to guid and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it. When therefore vve read, That Chriſt cured the blind, and gave them their ſight, vve may vvell imagine, that it vvas a vvonderfull benefit that he did for them. And therefore it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Yet this is a bleſſing vvhich fevv do ever think of, but find the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and comfort of it, <hi>Carendo magis, quam fruendo,</hi> rather vvhen vve vvant then vvhen vve have it. If vve vvanted our ſight, vvhat a benefit ſhould vve loſe, vvhat a loſſe ſhould vve have, and vvhat vvould vve not give that vve might recover it? And therefore vvhen vve hear hovv Chriſt cured the blind, or vvhen vve ſee any that vvant their ſight, it ſhould put us in mind vvhat a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it is that vve can ſee, and therefore ſhould be thankfull to God for it: yet though it be grievous to vvant the ſight, and a great bleſſing to have the ſame: yet it is far more grievous vvhen the mind is darkened, and vvants the eyes of knovvledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. For that vvhich the eye is to the body, the ſame is the underſtanding unto the ſoule; and vvhat blindneſſe is to the one, the ſame is ignorance to the other. And therefore vvhen Chriſt did cure them outvvardly, ſo vve may vvell think, that he cured them invvardly, as he took avvay their blindneſſe, and gave them their ſeeing, ſo he took avvay their ignorance, and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them vvith knovvledge and underſtanding. And this vvas a greater cure then the other. Men commonly think that a man that is blind, is far more miſerable then he that is ignorant; and that he, on the contrary, is in better condition that hath a ſound and comely body, then he whoſe mind is adorned and beautified with grace and virtue.</p>
            <p>But as the ſoule is more excellent then the body, ſo knowledge and underſtanding is more excellent then the ſight, becauſe the ſight doth onely give light to the body, underſtanding to the ſoule. They who want the eyes of their body, yet they know they want them, and therefore will carefully ſeek for help if they may be cured: and if they cannot be cured, yet they have this help, that they may have one to lead and guide them. But they who want the eyes of their mind, do not know their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore do not ſeek to have any help, but think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well though they live in ignorance; vvhereby the Devill leads them blind-fold to hell before they be aware.<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.18.19.</note>

And therefore as the blind here came unto Chriſt to be cured of their blindneſs, ſo we muſt likewiſe come unto him, to remove our ſpiritual blindneſſe from us: becauſe he is that <hi>day-ſpring from on high, as Zacharie ſaid, that came to viſit us, to give light unto them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As it is a great bleſſing to have the uſe of our eyes, and to be able to ſee, ſo it is a great bleſſing to have the uſe of our feete, and to be able to go. For God in framing the body of man, hath ſo diſpoſed of every part and Member of it, that we cannot ſpare any one of them all, becauſe all are neceſſary, every part being both ſerviceable one to another, and ſerving for the good of the whole body. If any part of the body do want any thing, all the reſt will afford it the beſt help they can, the tongue will aske what will do it good, the eare will liſten where it may be had, the eye will look after it, the foot will go for it, and the hand will bring it: and if any part be wanting, every part is the worſe for the want of it. The eye ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21.</note> cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you. For as the eye doth ſerve to ſee for the body, ſo doth the hand to work for it, and as the head is made to rule and govern the body, ſo the feet to uphold it, every part having his ſeveral uſe and office, and no part being needleſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Livie</hi> reports, that when there was diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Senators and the Commonalty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty refuſed to yield them aide, and the whole body of the Common-wealth was much troubled about it, <hi>Menenius Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> that was an excellent Orator being ſent to make reconciliation between them, did tell them this fable; That upon a time there fell out ſome variance between the belly and the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Members objected againſt the belly, that they were ſet a work to provide for it, and the belly in the mean while remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed idle and conſumed all. And therefore they all conſpired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they would not provide any longer for it, as they had done before. The foot refuſed to go any more for it, the hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118276:72"/>to reach any meat to the mouth, the mouth denied to take it, the teeth to chew it; but what became of this? The belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt ſtarved with hunger, the whole body was the worſe, the eyes waxt dim, and the eares dull, the hands grew weak, and the feete feeble, and all the Members began to faint and languiſh: and therefore in the end when they ſaw the danger, they were glad to be reconciled, having learned by experience, that there is not any part of the body needleſs, but where any one Member performes not the Office which belongs unto it, the whole body hath a want and is the worſe for it. Though the tongue can ſpeak, yet if the eare cannot heare, though the mouth can eat, yet if the hand cannot work; though the eye can ſee, yet if the foot cannot goe, it is a great defect to the whole body. Therefore as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reſtored the blind, and made them to ſee, which before they could not: So he cured the lame, and inabled them to walk, who before were not able to go or ſtand. Now ſome ye know fall lame by miſchance, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did, by falling when he was young out of his Nurſes Armes.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.4.</note> Some are borne lame from their Mothers wombe, as the Creple that we read of in the 3. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> How theſe became lame which were here cured by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is not ſet down,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 3.2.</note> but to be freed from their lameneſs howſoever it came, was a wonderfull bleſſing. For that which the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to the building, the ſame are the feet unto the body, as being made by God to bear and ſupport it. Therefore God hath placed them under all the reſt, to uphold all, becauſe the body is no more able to ſtand without them, then a building to ſtand without a foundation. Neither ſerve the feete onely to uphold the body, but likewiſe to carry it from place to place, whereſoever we have occaſion to go, without which we cannot ſtir from one place to another without paine or trouble. So grievous a thing it is to be lame, and ſo great a benefit to have the uſe of our feet, which as it may put us in mind of this duty, to be thankfull unto God for giving us the perfect uſe of our lims, which we might have wanted as well as others. So it may likewiſe teach us to uſe them well; to uſe our Members,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19.</note> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, as Servants unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. We find in the Goſpel, that many were every where brought unto Chriſt that were lame and impotent, and we cannot go any where but we ſee the like, all which are as it were ſo many Preachers unto us, to admoniſh us what God hath done for us, in giving us our lims, and therefore that we ought to uſe them well,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118276:72"/>to his glory, our good, and the benefit of others,<note place="margin">

            <p>And thus much briefly for the lame that were cured. The next cure which is here mentioned is that the Lepers were cleanſed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Leproſie</hi> was a grievous and fowle Diſeaſe, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Leper,</hi> was of all other that were diſeaſed, the moſt wretched and miſerable.</p>
            <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.46</note> as we ſee the <hi>Leper</hi> by Gods appointment was to live alone, and to be ſeparated from the fellowſhip of Gods People, as unworthy to come into a clean Company. In which reſpect, the four <hi>Lepers,</hi> that are mentioned when <hi>Samaria</hi> was beſieged,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14</note> dwelt out of the City, <hi>Myriam</hi> though ſhe was the Siſter of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> was removed out of the Camp, and <hi>Azariah</hi> though he were the King of <hi>Juda,</hi> yet being ſmote by God with a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>King,</hi> 15.5</note> he lived a part in a ſeveral houſe. So uncomfottable it was to have this Diſeaſe, becauſe they were excluded (as they are now that have the Plague) from all Company, which made many no doubt to pine away with grief and ſorrow, as being forlorne, and left utterly deſt tute of all help and comfort in their greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Leper</hi> did weare four markes to be known by, his garments torne, his head bare, his mouth covered,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.45.</note> and he was to cry unclean, unclean, that others might know that he had the <hi>Leproſie,</hi> and might ſhun and avoid him. For the <hi>Leproſie</hi> was a Diſeaſe among the <hi>Jewes</hi> that was ſtrangely infectious, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected not onely the perſons themſelves, but their Garments and Houſes, and that in ſuch a manner, that as we ſee in the 14. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> the infection might be ſeen and diſcerned upon them, it would fret into their Garments, and eat into the very morter and ſtones of their walles; and though the walles were plaſtered all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, yet it would break through them, that they were faine ſometimes to pull down their houſes. Inſomuch, that ſome think (and it is very probable) that the <hi>Jewes</hi> in a proper and peculiar manner, were troubled with this Diſeaſe, which is unknown in theſe dayes, as ye know there are many Diſeaſes now, which have not been known in former ages.</p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:118276:73"/>
            <p>Now though the <hi>Leproſie</hi> was a grievous Diſeaſe, yet there is a Diſeaſe, the <hi>Leproſie</hi> of ſin, that is farre more grievous. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Leproſie</hi> infects but the body, but this ſpiritual <hi>Leproſie</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the ſoule; ſo that no <hi>Leper</hi> is ſo unclean in the ſight of man, as the ſinner is loathſome in the ſight of God. If we know of a man that hath an infectious Diſeaſe, we will be very wary how we come in his Company, for fear he infect us: But for thoſe whoſe Company is far more dangerous, who by drunkenneſſe and the like communicating ſins, do infect mens ſoules, many are ſo far from ſhunning their Company, that they take pleaſure therein, as if they took delight to be infected by them. We have not any of thoſe kind of <hi>Lepers</hi> which the <hi>Jewes</hi> had, but of theſe kind of <hi>Lepers,</hi> that by drunkenneſſe do daily infect others, I would we had not too many in every place. Thoſe <hi>Lepers</hi> were ſeparated from the Congregation, and were not ſuffered to come among them; but theſe <hi>Lepers</hi> that are drunk from morning to night, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day in the week, and ſo continue infecting others all the year long, are not aſhamed to ſhew their faces amongſt us, but come openly to Church into the Congregation. Thoſe <hi>Lepers</hi> were conſtrained to live a part by themſelves, but theſe have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to frequent <hi>Tavernes</hi> and <hi>Ale-houſes,</hi> where for the moſt part they are the welcomeſt gueſts. Thoſe <hi>Lepers</hi> had their Cloathes rent in ſigne of their ſorrow, and did acknowledge themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; but theſe are ſo far from acknowledging their fault, that they take a pride in their ſin, and glory in their ſhame, boaſting that they are able to make others drunk, as if it were a Credit and commendation unto them. Thoſe <hi>Lepers</hi> would gladly have been rid of their Diſeaſe, and therefore came unto Chriſt to be cleanſed, and he did cleanſe them. But what hope can theſe have to be cleanſed by Chriſt, who delight in their <hi>Leproſie</hi> and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave it? Chriſt indeed is that skilfull <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> that cures both our corporal and ſpiritual Diſeaſes, but it is onely of ſuch as are loaden and weary of the burthen of their ſins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing more then to be rid of them. And therefore if they would be cured of their ſpiritual <hi>Leproſie,</hi> they muſt be weary of it, and have an earneſt deſire, and do their beſt indeavour to be freed from it, and then coming to Chriſt, as theſe <hi>Lepers</hi> did, they ſhall be cleanſed.</p>
            <p>The next cure which is here mentioned, is that <hi>the deaf heard.</hi> We read in the Scripture of two ſorts of deafneſſe, the one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:118276:73"/>the other ſpirituall. The corporall deafneſſe when the eare cannot hear is a great defect, and in ſome reſpect, it is better for a man to want his ſight then to want his hearing; becauſe by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we attaine more knowledge then we do by ſeeing. For hearing is the ſenſe of knowledge and diſcipline: in which regard, <hi>Salomon</hi> when he begins to teach us Wiſdom, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 1.8. firſt knocks at the doore where Wiſdom muſt enter and cries, <hi>hearken my Sonne.</hi> For Wiſdom and Knowledge is got chiefly by hearing, and, as ſome have thought, is rather leſſened and impared then increaſed by ſeeing. Therefore we read of ſome of the Philoſophers, who purpoſely put out their own eyes, that they might the better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto knowledge, wherein they thought that their ſight would hinder them, and diſtract their minds with variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And we read of many blind men that never ſaw at all, but were born blind; and yet have been famous for their wiſdome and knowledge. But we never heard of any man that was deafe from his birth and could never hear, that ever attained to knowledge and underſtanding in any meaſure. For how ſhould they have underſtanding in any thing, to know what they ſhould do or leave undone, which they were never taught? and how ſhould they be taught who could never hear, and ſo are uncapable of learning any thing? Therefore though God have ſtrook ſome blind; and ſome dumb; yet he ſtrook them not deaf but ſpared their hearing. Though he ſtrook <hi>Zachary</hi> dumb <hi>Luke</hi> 1. for his unbelief,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9.</note> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> blind <hi>Acts</hi> 9. for perſecuting the Church; yet he left them their hearing, becauſe if he had ſtrook them deaf withall, they could not have known his will. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>and they that hear the words of this Prophecy.</hi> Some cannot read, as they which are blind, and they which were never taught; yet they are not excluded from this bleſſing, becauſe they may hear it read: but they who are deaf can neither read it themſelves, nor hear it read by others. Yet I ſpeak not this as if they who are born deaf, are therefore abſolutely excluded from this bleſſedneſſe, but that they are excluded from the means of it. Yet God can ſave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means; and we may well think that God who is ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will not exact the imployment of a talent, where he hath not given it.</p>
            <p>I might further ſhew you many great inconveniences which come by deafneſſe, whereby we might ſee, what a benefit it was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118276:74"/>which Chriſt did for them, in taking their deafneſſe away from them; and what a bleſſing we have of God, in that he hath given us the ſenſe of hearing. But though this outward deafneſſe of the eare, be a grievous defect, yet there is a deafneſſe, the deafneſſe of the heart, (whereby obſtinate ſinners will not ſuffer that which they hear with their eares to enter into their hearts) which is farre more grievous. Such are they, who are compared by the Prophet <hi>David to the deafe adder, that will not hearken to the voice of the charmer;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4, 5. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.20.</note> but <hi>though wiſdom cry aloud in the ſtreets, yet they will not hear her.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who though <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> cryed daily unto him, <hi>Dimitte populum,</hi> Let my people goe, and though God thundred from Heaven with his judgements upon him, yet he would not heare them. And ſo though a man, as God willed the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.1.</note> 
               <hi>life up his voice like a Trumpet,</hi> and cry never ſo loud, againſt covetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, drunkenneſſe and the like; yet many ſtop their eares, and will not ſuffer what they hear to ſinke into their hearts. This is a willfull and obſtinate deafneſſe. And this deafneſſe, untill our hearts be opened as <hi>Lydia's</hi> was, is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in every one of us. And therefore as the deaf here came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: ſo every one of us muſt come unto him to be cured of this deafneſſe.</p>
            <p>The next cure which is here mentioned, is Chriſt's rayſing of the dead.</p>
            <p>His rayſing of the dead was a more miraculous cure then any of the former. The blind and the deaf whom Chriſt reſtored, did onely want their ſight and their hearing, and had the reſt of their ſences, the lame whom he cured did onely want the uſe of their feet and had the reſt of their limbs; the Lepers whom he cleanſed did onely want their health, and had the uſe of their limbs and ſences; but they which vvere dead had none of them all, but vvere deprived of them altogether: and ſo his rayſing of ſuch as vvere dead was a greater work then any of the former.

            <p>The laſt thing which is here mentioned, is that <hi>the poore had the Goſpel preached unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath annointed me to preach good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings unto the poore, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaime liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound.</hi> Which words Chriſt expounding <hi>Luke</hi> 4. when he preached in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he applies them to himſelf, <hi>This day</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">

               <hi>is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares;</hi> to ſhew that he was annointed of God to preach the Goſpel unto the poor. Now by the poor to whom he preached the Goſpel, they are underſtood, who are ſaid by our Saviour <hi>Math.</hi> 5.3. <hi>to be poor in ſpirit.</hi> For there are two ſorts of poverty, the one outward, vvhen a man hath not means to maintain himſelf but wants outward neceſſaries; the other inward vvhen a man is deſtitute of ſpirituall graces. And thus every one of us all are poor, but ſome do not ſee their poverty and want, as the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>diceans, Revel.</hi> 3.17. that <hi>thought themſelves rich, and increaſed with goods, when they were poor and naked.</hi> Some ſee their poverty, and find in themſelves a want of grace, and therefore do hunger and thirſt after it; and theſe are the poore to whom Chriſt is ſaid here to have preached the Goſpel. Therefore in the place which I named before, the Prophet ſhews to what poor the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be preached, by naming preſently <hi>the broken hearted,</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.2. The Lord promiſeth, <hi>to have reſpect unto him, that is poore and of a contrite Spirit;</hi> the latter of theſe explaining the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:118276:75"/>former, that they are the poor whom God reſpects, who are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſight of their ſpirituall wants, and bewaile nothing more then their want of grace. Such were they to whom Chriſt here preacht, as knowing that the Goſpel which is the glad tydings of ſalvation, would be moſt welcome unto them, becauſe it offers grace unto thoſe who finding in themſelves a want of grace, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly and earneſtly deſire the ſame.</p>
            <p>Here then we ſee who they be that are fit to hear the Goſpel, and that do find comfort in hearing of it; namely, ſuch as do ſee their ſpirituall poverty, and feele in their hearts a want of grace; &amp; therefore renouncing their own righteouſnes, do flie unto Chriſt to find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To draw then briefly to a concluſion of all, if we would reape comfort by the preaching of the Goſpel, vve muſt labour to ſee our ſpirituall poverty, to find in our ſelves our vvant of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our want of faith, our vvant of grace, and then the good tydings of the Goſpel will be as vvelcome to us, as cold waters to a traveller that is weary,<note place="margin">

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey are the words of the Church, expreſſing her longing deſire after Chriſt.<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> And in the words we may obſerve theſe three things; the Act, the Object, and the Circumſtances; the Act, ſought, the Object, Chriſt, <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoule loves;</hi> and the Circumſtances are two, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time, and the circumſtance of place; the time when ſhe ſought him, <hi>I ſought him by night,</hi> and the place where ſhe ſought him, <hi>I ſought him on my Bed, By night on my Bed I ſought him whom my ſoul loves.</hi> And theſe are the parts, I will begin with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, becauſe they are ſet downe firſt in the words. And firſt for the time when ſhe ſought Chriſt, it was <hi>by night.</hi> Now night is taken two wayes in the Scripture. Sometime litterally, ſometime metaphorically: litterally for the time which is oppoſite to the day; when the Sun hath paſſed over our Horizon and leaves us darkneſſe, through the interpoſition of the Earth between the Sun &amp; us. So the night is taken litterally, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They that are drunke are drunke in the night. Implying thereby that then drunkards were aſhamed to be drunke in the day,</hi> (which now a daies they are not) but were drunk in the night that they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118276:76"/>might the better conceal it. Sometime <hi>night</hi> is taken metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, as when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>The night is far ſpent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12.</note> 
               <hi>the day is at hand, let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſſe, and let us put on the armour of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in my Text, as I take it, the night is not taken metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, becauſe it is added, by night on my bed, which being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, do ſhew that they are both to be taken literally.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then here obſerve the Churches ſincerity, <hi>By prayer ſhe ſought Chriſt, not openly in the day to be ſeen of men, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were wont to pray in the ſtreets, but ſecretly in the night,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>when there were none to ſee or hear what ſhe did. Ille colit vere, qui ſine teſte colit,</hi> He worſhips Chriſt truly, who worſhips him when there is no witneſſe of it. Many will do that openly where they may be ſeen and commended, which they will not do ſecretly where they are not ſeen to do it: like the Monk that would faſt whole dayes together, whil'ſt he was in the Monaſterie, where men ſaw and commended him for faſting ſo long, but when he was in the Deſart he could not faſt, becauſe there were none to ſee him. This was hypocriſie, but where there is ſincerity, a man will rather do good in ſecret, that he may not be known to do it.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly here obſerve the Churches Wiſdome, She ſought Chriſt by prayer, and made choiſe of the night as the fitteſt time to pray in. When we pray in the night, our ears and our eyes are not carried away with variety of objects, which many times ſo hinder us when we pray in the day that we cannot mind our prayers. And therefore it is, that commonly when we pray in the Church, we ſet our hands or our hats before our eyes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the day as it were night, that our eyes being not troubled with outvvard objects, our hearts may the better mind our prayers.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Here obſerve the <hi>Churches importunity:</hi> For that vvhich is here tranſlated <hi>by night,</hi> is by nights in the originall, implying that ſhe ſought him night by night, and would not give over, but
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118276:77"/>continued importunate <hi>like the woman of Canaan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>til ſhe had obtained her deſire:</hi> Chriſt likes an importunate ſuiter that will take no demall, a wearileſſe ſeeker that ſeeks while he findes, and till he finde what he ſeeks, will never give over. Such a ſuiter, ſuch a ſeeker was the Church here, <hi>ſhe ſought him night by night,</hi> and though as it is ſaid in the next words, <hi>ſhe found him not,</hi> yet ſhe ſtill perſevered, and never lin ſeeking untill ſhe had found him.</p>
            <p>And as ſhe ſought him by night, ſo on her bed. As the night is the time, ſo the bed is the place to reſt in, but when others were aſleep, and taking their reſt, the Church was awake, and her thoughts and deſires wholy ſet upon Chriſt. So that as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith of <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> when ſhe came to Chriſts Sepulchre, and found him not there, <hi>Maria ibi non erat ubi non erat, quia to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ibi non erat ubi Magiſter erat, Mary</hi> was not there where ſhe was, but was wholly there where her Maſter was, So the Church was not there where ſhe ſought Chriſt, but was wholly there where Chriſt was whom ſhe ſought. So wholly with him in deſire and affection, that ſhe could find no reſt, no not in the place of reſt, but in thinking of him. As the Church here ſought Chriſt, ſo muſt we that are Chriſtians, we muſt ſeek him by prayer <hi>night by night</hi> in our beds, not ſuffering our eyes any night to ſleep, nor the temples of our heads to take any reſt, vvithout ſeeking of him. <hi>For if David would not ſuffer his eyes to ſleep, till he had found out a place for the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> then much leſſe ſhould vve, till we have found the Lord of the Houſe, even him whom here the Church ſought <hi>night by night</hi> on her bed. And thus much briefly for the two circumſtances, the time and place, when and where ſhe ſought Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the Act in the vvord <hi>Sought, By night on my bed I ſought him.</hi> Now <hi>Seeking</hi> implies theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A want of that which is ſought. For a man will not carefully ſeek that which he doth not want, but that vvhich he wants he will ſeek vvith the more diligence: as a man that is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry will ſeek food becauſe he wants it, but if he were not hungry, and vvanted not food, he would not ſeek it. So that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing implies a vvant or need of that which is ſought.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Seeking</hi> implies a deſire of finding that vvhich vve ſeek. For though a man do vvant a thing, yet if he have not vvithall a deſire to finde it, he vvill not ſeek it: as a man that is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118276:77"/>in priſon, though he want his liberty, yet he will not ſeek it, unleſs he have likewiſe a deſire to have it: So that ſeeking implies not onely a want of that which is ſought, but a deſire to find it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Seeking implies a hope and poſſibility of finding that which we ſeeke. For though a man do want a thing, and though he be never ſo deſirous to have it, yet if there be no hope of finding the ſame, he will not ſeek it; as a man that is ſick, though he want his health, and be deſirous to have it, yet if there be no poſſibility and hope of his recovery, he will give over ſeeking it. And in all theſe reſpects we are to ſeek Chriſt as the Church here doth. For there is nothing that we want ſo much as Chriſt, nothing to be deſired in compariſon of Chriſt, and nothing ſo eaſily found as Chriſt, which are ſo many motives to make us the more willing to ſeek Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is nothing that we want ſo much as Chriſt. We are all by nature the Children of wrath, enemies to God, and bond-ſlaves to Satan, and through the diſobedience of our firſt Parents, <hi>Damnati priùs quàm nati,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> guilty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condemnation before we were borne. From this miſerable condition we could not free our ſelves, neither could we be freed by any other but Chriſt, whom God hath made,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, to be wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption unto us: all which we muſt needes want, if we have not him from whom we muſt have them: and ſo there is nothing that we want ſo much as Chriſt. Many indeed do not find in themſelves any want of Chriſt, becauſe all their life-time they have lived without Chriſt in their natural eſtate, and never have known any better condition. For it fares with ſuch, as it fares with them that are borne blind, who becauſe they never had the benefit of ſight, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well conceive what it is to want it. And ſo theſe having never found any comfort in Chriſt, do not know what it is to want him: but if it pleaſe God to open their eyes, that they may finde in themſelves a want of grace, and ſee the miſery they are in for want of the ſame, they will ſee they want nothing ſo much as Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That there is nothing to be deſired in compariſon of Chriſt, we may ſee by this, becauſe whatſoever we can deſire without Chriſt, can never ſatisfie us and give us content. For till we be aſſured, that Chriſt hath took upon him the diſcharge of our debts, and hath reconciled us to God: our ſins muſt needes be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118276:78"/>ſuch a wound to our ſoules, and a terrour to our Conſcience, that nothing can give us any true contentment. The riches, pleaſures, and preferments of this World, may give a man ſome little content for a time, but ever and anon they are ready to faile him, and when affliction, ſickneſſe or death comes, they do all forſake him. Onely the comfort which he hath in Chriſt, both in ſickneſs and health, both in life and death, will never leave him, and ſo nothing is to be deſired in compariſon of Chriſt. Nay, whatſoever we can deſire for our good, we may have it in him; for God hath made him to be all in all unto us, that in him we might have every thing. If we be terrified with the ſight of our ſins,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71.</note> he is that Saviour that came into the World to ſave ſinners. If we deſire light and fear darkneſs; he is that day-ſpring from on high that came to viſit us. If we be hungry and deſire food,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>John</hi> 4.14.</note> he is the bread of life that came down from Heaven. If we be thirſty and deſire to drink, he is the Fountain of living water, whereof he that drinks ſhall never thirſt again. If we deſire to go to Heaven, he is the way. If we deſire to be freed from error,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 14.6.</note> he is the truth. If we deſire to be freed from death, he is the life: In a word, whatſoever we can deſire for our good, we may have it in him who hath every thing: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet omnia qui habet habentem omnia,</hi> He that hath him who hath all things, hath all things with him; and ſo nothing is to be deſired in compariſon of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As we want nothing ſo much as Chriſt, and as nothing is to be deſired in compariſon of Chriſt, ſo nothing is ſo eaſily found as Chriſt. For he invites all to come unto him, he never rejected any that came, but was alwayes found of all thoſe that ſought him.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) a reſpector of times. And we ſee that after his Reſurrection from death, he commanded his Diſciples to preach the Goſpel all over the World in all Countries, to ſhew that he is not (<gap reason="foreign">

And though our coming unto him be for our good, for otherwiſe we cannot but everlaſtingly periſh,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:118276:78"/>yet he uſeth many motives to perſwade us to come.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.23.</note> To make us the more willing to come unto him, he invites us in the Goſpel by the parable of the King, that made a great feaſt for the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Sonne, and ſent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden.</p>
            <p>To ſhew how willing he is to receive us if we come, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the parable of the prodigal Sonne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20.</note> who but coming to his Father, his Father made more haſte and ranne forth to meet him, fell on his neck and kiſſed him, and received him as joyfully, as if he had never offended him. To ſhew us the danger of deferring our coming, and putting it off as many do, the whole time of their life, he propounds the parable of the fooliſh Virgins,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.11.12.</note> who were excluded out of Heaven, becauſe they were not ready at the time to meete the Bridegroome. Yet to hearten us any time while we live to come, he propounds the parable of thoſe that were called into the Vineyard, and ſhewes that he who came at the eleaventh houre, did not loſe his reward, but received his hire.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, though we be ſtray'd away from him, and do not ſeek him, he ſhewes by the Parable of the loſt ſheepe that he wil ſeek us;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4.</note> and never linne ſeeking untill he have found us: All plainly ſhewing, how ready he is to be found of us, who ſo graciouſly invites us to come unto him; ſo joyfully receives us when we come, and ſo carefully ſeekes us when we are ſtrai'd away from him.</p>
            <p>To wind up then that which hath been delivered in this point. If ſeeking implies a want of that which is ſought, a deſire to have it, and a hope and poſſibility of finding that which we ſeek: and if there be nothing that we want ſo much as Chriſt, nothing to be deſired in compariſon of Chriſt, and nothing ſo eaſily found as Chriſt, it muſt needes follow from hence, that we muſt above all things ſeek Chriſt as the Church here doth. But how far are the moſt from thus ſeeking Chriſt? ſome ſeek the favour of great perſons, ſome preferment and promotion; ſome ſeek their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſome wealth and riches, but Chriſt hath few ſeekers, and many are hindred from ſeeking Chriſt by their ſeeking of theſe. You know how they who were bidden in the Goſpel to that great feaſt, pretended excuſes why they could not come:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 14 18.19.20.</note> one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be excuſed becauſe he had bought a peece of ground, and ſo could not come, becauſe he muſt go to ſee it; another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had bought five yoke of <hi>Oxen,</hi> and muſt go to prove them: another, becauſe he had married a wife, and therefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118276:79"/>could not come. All theſe things were ſuch as might lawfully be done, but not ſufficient to excuſe them for not coming to Chriſt, whom as we want, ſo we muſt ſeek above all things. And this we cannot do till we can truely ſay, as the Church here doth, <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoul loves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein ſhe expreſſes her unfeigned love and affection to Chriſt, which kindled her deſire the more to ſeek him. <hi>Anima eſt ubi amat non ubi animat,</hi> the ſoul is where it loves, not where it lives. And therefore the Church thus loving Chriſt could not chuſe but ſeek him, as counting it her happineſſe to injoy his preſence, and to live with him.</p>
            <p>The Courch ye know is Chriſts ſpouſe, and there is nothing ſo tedious to lovers, and which they can leſſe indure then one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abſence. Hence was that vehement longing of the Church for Chriſts firſt coming, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam dirumperes Caelos,</hi> O that thou wouldſt rent the Heavens and come down! as wiſhing rather that the Heavens ſhould be rent aſunder,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.1.</note> then that he ſhould ſtay there, and ſhe ſtay here and be abſent from him. And hence it was that when Chriſt was to leave the World and told his Diſciples before-hand of it, their hearts were troubled, and though he told them, <hi>that he went to prepare a place for them, that he went to his Father, that he would ſend them another Comforter that ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with them for ever;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 16.6.</note> yet ſtill <hi>their hearts were filled with ſorrow, becauſe he would leave them,</hi> as being more willing to bear any loſſe then to indure his abſence; and being no more able to be without him if he ſhould leave them a while, then for Ivey to be without a tree or a wall, whereunto if it cleave not it will fade and wither: ſo grievous it was to them that loved Chriſt, not to injoy his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Now as it was with the Diſciples and here with the Church: ſo it is with all thoſe that do truely love Chriſt, they deſire his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and bewaile his abſence, more then any thing beſides. Every one of us as we bear the name of Chriſtians, ſo we will profeſſe our love unto Chriſt, and be ready to ſay that we love him unfeignedly; but if we examine our ſelves for the tryall of our love and affection to him, we ſhall many of us find, that though we have <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice yet we have <hi>Eſau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.27.</note> Chriſt requires that we love him above all, and ſaith, that <hi>he that loves Father, mother, Sonne or Daughter more then him, is not worthy of him;</hi> yet how many things are there that we love
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118276:79"/>more then Chriſt? If we have a friend whom we truely love' becauſe vve love him we vvill be loth to do anything that ſhall offend him; nay, vve vvill take his part vvhen he is ſpoken againſt, and vvill be offended vvith them that do ſpeak againſt him: But vvhen vve hear Chriſt diſhonoured, and his name blaſphemed by all manner of ſwearing, vve can often hold our peace, vvithout being offended and reproving thoſe that do thus diſhonour him, and do vve not then love our friends more then vve love Chriſt?</p>
            <p>If we have a friend vvhom vve truely love, becauſe vve love him, vve vvill take his Counſell and follovv his advice, before any others that Counſell us othervviſe; yet vvhen Chriſt ſtands on the one ſide, and covetouſneſſe on the other, and gives us contrary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: vvhen Chriſt on the one ſide vvills us to give to the poore, to feed the hungry and to cloath the naked; and covertouſneſſe on the other ſide vvills us to part vvith nothing, but to get vvhat vve can, we follow rather what covetouſneſſe then what Chriſt Counſels us, and do we not then love our riches more then we love Chriſt? Chriſt on the one ſide wills us to follow him and we do it not, our pleaſures on the other ſide to follow them and we do it, and do we not then love our pleaſures more then we love Chriſt?</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> conſidered the wonderfull love of God unto man, he knew not what to think of it; but he cryed out in admiration, <hi>Lord what is man that thou art ſo mindfull of him,</hi>

            <p>He loved us ſo dearly that he thought not his life too dear for us, but ſuffered a moſt ſhamefull and accurſed death, to free us from the curſe which was due unto us: yet we for requitall of this his love (though love be requited with nothing but love: as fire is kindled with nothing but fire) do ſo little regard him, that we preferre our friends, our pleaſures, our wealth and riches, and for the moſt part whatſoever we love, before him.</p>
            <p>How farre are ſuch from being able to ſay truly as the Church here doth, I ſought him whom my ſoule loves. Her love unto
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118276:80"/>Chriſt was not verbal and outward, from the rine of the lipps, but real and inward from the root of the heart, from her ſoule and ſpirit, her ſoule loved him, ſhe loved him, as the Church, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. deſired and ſought him, <hi>with my ſoule have I deſired thee in the night;</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </gap>, but inward love from the ſoule is alwayes unfained. And ſuch a love it is which Chriſt doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and no other, that we love him with the heart, and with the ſoule, with all the heart, and with all the ſoule: So precious doth he account our love, that he will not have ſo much as the leaſt grain of it loſt, but will have it all. He hath millions of Angels that are inflamed with his love, who love him far better then we do or can, and our love unto Chriſt is no benefit to him, he reapes no prophet nor advantage by it, only becauſe he loves us, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires again to be beloved of us, and that unfainedly from our very ſoules. He will not have the ſoule and love divided, he likes not that ſoule that is without love, nor that love which comes not from the ſoule. If love come unto him and not from the ſoule, before he admit it he will firſt aske whence it came, as <hi>Micha</hi> asked the <hi>Levite</hi> before he received him. And if the ſoule come unto him without love, he will forbid it to come, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> forbad his Brethren,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>And therefore if we will come unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.3.</note> we muſt come with love, with love from our ſoules, as the Church here doth, <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoule loves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw then to a concluſion, that we may be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſeek Chriſt; let us meditate on thoſe things which may kindle and inflame our love towards him, by conſidering how he deſires our love and deſerves the ſame.</p>
            <p>If a man have ſhewed us any extraordinary kindneſs, and hath deſerved our love, we could not but condemn our ſelves of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs if we did not love him: Nay, though he have not deſerved our love by any kindneſs he hath ſhewed us, yet if we do but heare that he is deſirous of our love, becauſe this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he loves us, we will love him again. But Chriſt doth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118276:80"/>both deſire our love and deſerve the ſame. He deſires our love, not for his own but for our good, that he might have occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite our love. And therefore he uſeth moſt forcible Reaſons to procure our love: Sometimes intreating us, and making it his earneſt ſuit that we would love him.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> We ſaith the Apoſtle, are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as God beſeeching you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead (but for what?) to be reconciled unto God. Here is the ſtrongeſt ſute that ever was made: God and man were fallen out, man is the party that hath offended, and God is the party that ſues to be reconciled; man that ſhould intreat God that he would forgive him, is intreated by God that he would be content to be forgiven. Thus he ſues for our love that ſhould ſue for his. Nay, he uſeth not onely intreaty to procure our love, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the promiſe of infinit rewards. <hi>The eye,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hath not ſeen, the eare hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man, what God hath prepared</hi> (but for whom?) <hi>for them that love him.</hi> Was it ever heard of ſince the World began, that any man ever came to a poor begger, and offring him meat that was ready to ſtarve and to periſh for hunger, ſhould intreat him to eat it, and not onely ſo, but wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al, ſhould promiſe to reward him for it? But God, though it be for our good that we love him, for otherwiſe we cannot but everlaſtingly periſh; yet he intreats us that we would love him, and not onely ſo, but promiſeth withall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our love with the Kingdom of Heaven. So earneſtly doth he deſire our love. And as he deſires ſo he deſerves our love. If we ſhould give a man but his diet or houſeroome, we would think we deſerved he ſhould lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e us for it. How then doth he deſerve our love that gives us every thing? The very bread which we eat, nay the breath which we breath, we have it from him, in whom we live, and move, and have our being, and cannot live a minute without his bleſſing. The leaſt bleſſing he gives us deſerves our love, and we have nothing but our love to give him for all that he gives us. So abundantly doth he deſerve our love. Great reaſon have we then to require his love in ſome meaſure, by loving him unſeignedly as the Church here doth, <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoule loves.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are part of <hi>Agurs</hi> Prayer, and his Prayer in the whole verſe conſiſts of two parts, a deprecation of evil, and a Petition of good. The evil which he deprecates or prayes againſt is of two ſorts, either ſuch as is ſimply evil in it own nature, as vanity and lying, againſt which he prayes in the beginning of this verſe, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move farre from me vanity and lies:</hi> Or ſuch as are not ſimplie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in their own nature, but yet may be occaſions of evil, as riches and poverty, againſt which he prayes in the next words, <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches.</hi> The good which he prayes for is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Eſtate, in the end of this verſe, a mediocrity between the two extreams of want and ſuperfluity. <hi>Feed me with food conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me.</hi> And theſe are the parts of the whole verſe.</p>
            <p>Here then he prayes that God would give him neither poverty nor riches, neither over little nor over much, that he may neither live in want, nor yet in abundance; not becauſe theſe in themſelves are evil, but becauſe they may be, and many times are occaſions of evill.</p>
            <p>To begin with the former, Poverty may be an occaſion of evill
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118276:81"/>two wayes, firſt, of evill to him that is poor; and ſecondly, of evill to others, through his being poor.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of evill to him that is poor, becauſe poverty doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make a man diſcontented and envious: diſcontented with his preſent eſtate, becauſe he hath ſo little, and envious towards thoſe whom he ſees to have more: and theſe two, <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> do commonly make thoſe that live in want, to live in miſery. Though a man have but little, though he have no more then will ſuffice nature, though he have but food and rayment; yet if he have the virtue of contentation, if he have learn'd with <hi>Jacob, to deſire no more, but bread to eat, and clothes to put on;</hi>

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Job</hi> 1.21.</note> if he have learn'd with <hi>Job, to bleſſe God as well when all his goods are taken away, as when he had them;</hi> if he have learn'd with <hi>Paul, in what eſtate ſoever he is, therewith to be content,</hi>

               <hi>and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed both how to abound, and to ſuffer need:</hi> then any eſtate will be pleaſing unto him, becauſe he lives contented; but where this contentation is wanting, as it is for the moſt part in thoſe that live in want, there the life is unpleaſant, as we ſee by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. <hi>16.3.</hi>
               </note> who preſently cried out when they were in want <hi>Would to God we had died in the Land of Egypt</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Poverty doth make a man diſcontented becauſe he hath ſo little, ſo it makes him envious towards thoſe that have more: as <hi>Rachell</hi> envied her Siſter <hi>Lea, Gen.</hi> 30.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe her ſiſter had children, and ſhe had none.</hi> For envy is a repining at anothers vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and therefore whoſoever he be that is envious, muſt needs be miſerable whereſoever he is: and if it were poſſible for an envious perſon to be in heaven where there is nothing but felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet becauſe there are degrees of glory there, and he ſhould ſee others in higher glory then himſelf, he vvould be miſerable, and could not be vvell while he ſavv another better. Therefore <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> calls envy <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. <hi>the rottenneſſe of the bones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.30.</note> becauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is as hurtfull to the mind and body, as rottenneſſe is that lies in the bones, which eates up the marrovv, conſumes the fleſh, and makes the body to pine and languiſh. And this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill which is occaſioned by want, that for the moſt part it makes thoſe that have but little, to be envious towards thoſe that have more then themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as poverty is an occaſion of evill to him that is poor, ſo of evill to others through his being poor; becauſe want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dravvs a man to uſe unlavvfull means, for the bettering of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118276:82"/>his eſtate, and ſupplying of his vvants, even to the damage and hurt of others. As ſometimes by borrovving and not repaying. For he that is in want, is commonly more ready to borrovv vvhat he needs then to pay what he borrows, he is forvvard in borrowing but backward in paying, vvhich <hi>David</hi> notes to be the property of a bad man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21.</note> 
               <hi>The wicked</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>borroweth, and payeth not again.</hi> For a man to be in want, ſo he be not in vvant through his ovvn fault, is no ſin, and to borrovv vvhat he vvants, ſo he repay vvhat he borrovvs, is no ſin: but to fall into vvant through his ovvn fault, through idleneſſe, drinking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftineſſe, and the like, and ſo to be driven to borrovv, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his vvants, and aftervvards to be careleſſe to pay vvhat he borrovvs, this is a ſin, and this commonly is the ſin of ſuch as are in vvant. Yet he that is in vvant, though he pay not vvhat he borrovvs, he thinks it no fault, becauſe he of vvhom he borrovvs is better able to bear it then he is to pay it. But vvhat though he be? Would'ſt thou be content, if another vvho is not ſo ſtrong as thou art, having an heavy burden lying upon him, ſhould remove it from his ovvn, and lay it on thy back, becauſe thou art ſtronger, and better able to bear it? Thy vvant is thy burden which God hath appointed thee to bear, and ſhouldeſt thou disburden thy ſelf thereof, and lay it upon another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is better able to bear the ſame? mighteſt thou not as well by the ſame reaſon, deny to pay thy Land-lord the rent of thy houſe, becauſe he is better able to bear the loſſe of the rent then thou to pay it? &amp; therefore thy poverty will not excuſe thee for doing wrong, as thou doeſt when thou borrovveſt and payeſt not again. Yet poverty ſometimes doth draw men to a greater evill then this, even to ſteal from others to ſupply their own vvants. For want is often an occaſion of theft.

               </note> Thus <hi>the unjuſt Steward, Luke</hi> 16. <hi>fell from want to theft.</hi> For when he ſaw that his Lord had given him warning to give over his ſtewardſhip, he bethought himſelfe what courſe of life he ſhould take, to ſupply his wants when he was turned out of ſervice, and being unwilling to labour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to begge, he reſolved to ſteal, and in his accounts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Lord for his own advantage. And thus many will do if they be in want, and think that their want will excuſe them for it.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118276:82"/>But will thy want excuſe thee for doing that which God hath forbidden thee? muſt God be diſhonoured becauſe thou art in want? &amp; were it not better for thee to ſuffer want for a time, then that God ſhould juſtly condemne thee for ever, for thy diſobeying him? God never ſuffers any ſo to be in want, that their want will excuſe them for ſinning againſt him, but though he give them not all that they want, yet all that they want is not ſo much as that which he gives them, and they may finde more comfort in that which they have, then their wants can diſcomfort them. Though the poor have mean houſes, and hard lodging, yet this may be their comfort (which is a great bleſſing of God) that they can ſleep in their houſes, and take their reſt in the night time, and commonly more ſoundly then rich men do, <hi>Qui vigilant in-plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks, who lie awake and cannot ſleep in their beds of down. Therefore, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi> Though the poor have many a hard meale, and very ſlender fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though the poor may not come into great mens houſes, but are kept out by Porters, yet they have free liberty to come into Gods Houſe; and though they have not acceſſe to rich mens tables, yet they may have acceſſe to the Table of the Lord as well as the richeſt. And though here the poor toile and take great pains to ſupply their wants, yet this may be their comfort, That God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them (if they ſerve him) a place of reſt hereafter, and that the time is but ſhort that they ſhall live in want, and be forced thereby to toile and take paines, for when they die, they ſhall be freed from their wants, <hi>and ſhall reſt from their labours.</hi>

            <p>And as <hi>Agur</hi> here prayes, That God would not give him pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo likewiſe that God would not give him riches, <hi>Give me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neither poverty, nor riches.</hi> To pray againſt poverty (which many ſo fear) is no more then the moſt will do; but to pray againſt riches (which the moſt ſo deſire) may be thought a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. But <hi>Agur</hi> here deſiring rather to be good then great, and fearing that riches would make him worſe, he praies <hi>that God would not give him riches.</hi> Though riches be not evill in their own nature, yet they may be (as we heard before of poverty) occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of evill, occaſions of evill to him that is rich, and of evill to others through his being rich. Firſt, Of evill to him that is rich. For riches do often make men proud, and to forget God. This <hi>Agur</hi> implies in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> by giving this reaſon why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he might not be rich, <hi>Leaſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord?</hi> For none are ſo prone to forget God, as they commonly are whom he hath bleſt with riches, though their riches ſhould make them the more to remember him, as gifts call to mind the givers of them.

            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:118276:83"/>
            <p>And as riches do ſteale mens hearts from God, and make them not to regard him: ſo ſometimes they ſteale mens hearts from themſelves, that they regard themſelves leſſe then they do their riches, and therefore toyle continually to get Wealth; and yet are not ſatisfied though they have more then enough.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Agur</hi> in the 15. and 16. <hi>ver.</hi> of this Chapter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the covetous rich-man to thoſe things that are the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable of all other: as to the <hi>Horſe-leach</hi> which is ever crying give give, which ſucks the blood untill ſhe be filled, and then ſhe fals off; and yet preſently after ſhe fals to it a freſh and is as hungry of it as ſhe was before: To the grave that never cries it is enough, but though it receive never ſo many dead bodies, yet it conſumes all; and is ſtill gaping as it were, and opening the mouth that it may receive more: To the earth that cannot be ſatisfied with water, but though ſometimes it be ſo glutted with raine, and made as it were drunken, ſo that it vomits it up againe, that a man would thinke that it had taken ſuch a ſurfet, that it would brook rain the worſe for a long time after; yet ye know if it be but without ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for a while, it will begin to chappe and chaune, and be as thirſty thereof as it was before: And ſo likewiſe to fire, which is of ſo inſatiable a nature, that it cannot be exſtinguiſht with adding few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell unto it; but the more fewell it has, the more greedy it is, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of all that is round about it; firſt of the chimney where it was firſt kindled, then of the roof of the houſe, then of the whole building; and yet it will not ſtay there, but will preſently take hold of the houſe that is next it, and ſo will ſtill go further &amp; further, till it have devour'd and conſumed whatſoever is nere it. Now as theſe are inſatiable, as the <hi>Horſe-leach</hi> is not ſatisfyed with ſucking blood, the grave with the dead, the earth with water nor the fire with fewell: no more can a covetous rich-man be ſatisfied with riches, though he have never ſo much.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that ſuch do make themſelves drudges to the world to get wealth; and yet grudge themſelves any part thereof, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leſſen that which they have. For the more they have,<note place="margin">Viri divitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> the more they deſire; their riches which ſhould be a medicine to cure them of covetouſneſſe, increaſing their diſeaſe, and making them more covetous, and leſſe willing to ſpend any thing upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For <hi>Mammon</hi> doth commonly uſe his ſervants, as Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers uſe their Aſſes in ſome Countries, loading them to the Market with good herbes, which are a burden to them and food for others,<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118276:84"/>and turning them when they have done to feed upon Thiſtles. And thus doth <hi>Mammon</hi> deale with his followers, loading them with wealth, and not ſuffering them to injoy the benefit thereof, but makes them to fare the more hardly themſelves to leave the more for others. This is called by <hi>Salomon Eccleſ. 6. an evill diſeaſe,</hi> whatſoever his heart deſires, and yet he hath no power to eate thereof, but ſpares from himſelf &amp; leaves it to ſtrangers: And thus riches are occaſions of evill to him that is rich.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To others through his being rich. For riches make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be ſcornfull and contemptuous towards their inferiours. For as poverty makes men to envy thoſe that have more then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs: ſo riches on the contrary to deſpiſe thoſe that have leſſe. This made the Church being in captivity, to ſay, <hi>Our ſoul, is filled with the ſcornfull reproof of the wealthy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.</note> becauſe they when they reprove do reprove ſcornfully. This we ſee by <hi>Nabal</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. whom though <hi>David</hi> did reverence becauſe he was rich,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.</note> &amp; called him Father, <hi>Give I pray thee</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to thy Sonne David;</hi> yet <hi>Nabal</hi> gave him a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full anſwer, <hi>Who is</hi> David <hi>and who is the Sonne of</hi> Jeſſe? There be many ſervants now a daies that break a way from their Maſters, ſhall I then take my bread and my water, and my fleſh that I have killed for my ſhearers, and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be, <hi>Lucri genus quoddam divites habent iram, odiſſe quà donare viliùs conſtat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Martial.</note> Rich men do make a gaine of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and are more ready to reprove then to give, becauſe it is cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It was fault enough in <hi>Nabal,</hi> to give nothing to <hi>David</hi> being then in want; but withall to reproach him becauſe he would give him nothing, made his fault the greater.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As riches make many to be ſcornfull and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous: ſo more ready to offer then to ſuffer injuries. For many preſume upon their wealth to do wrong, as knowing that they to whom they do it muſt be faine to put it up; becauſe they are not able to contend with them. But God hath not therefore given men wealth, to arme them thereby to do injuſtice; but to inable them the better to do good unto others. And therefore if God have made thee wealthy, thy wealth ſhould rather keep thee from wronging any, eſpecially thoſe, who are not of ability when they are wrong'd to help themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thou would'ſt count it great baſeneſſe in another if he ſhould fly upon thee with a weapon in his hand and ſtrike thee with it,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118276:84"/>when thou haſt none in thy hand to reſiſt him. And doeſt thou not the ſame when thou flieſt upon another, and doeſt him wrong, becauſe thou haſt wealth to bear thee out, &amp; the other hath none? How far would'ſt thou befro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bearing with him if he ſhould do thee wrong? For then thou wouldeſt ſay, ſhould ſuch a one as he do wrong unto me, and were it not a ſhame and diſgrace unto me if I ſhould ſuffer him? But indeed the meanneſſe of his condition ſhould rather move thee to bear with him. I am ſure our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moves God when we offend him to bear with us, our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes him to ſpare and pity us. For ſo ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103.14.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. where he gives this reaſon why God doth pity us, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our offences, and the reaſon is drawn from the baſeneſſe of our condition, <hi>For he</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) knows our frame, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that we are duſt.</hi> And therefore his meanneſſe that doth thee wrong, ſhould rather move thee to ſpare &amp; pardon him, as our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe moves God to pardon us when we ſin againſt him. We ſee then the reaſons why <hi>Agur</hi> praies that God would not give him riches, leſt his riches might be evill either to himſelfe, or to others, to himſelfe by making him proud, and not to regard God, or by making him covetous, and to regard himſelfe leſſe then he did his riches; or evill to others, by making him to ſcorne &amp; contemne his inferiours, and to be more ready to offer, then to ſuffer wrongs</p>
            <p>Here then obſerve from <hi>Agurs</hi> prayer to God, <hi>to give him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poverty, nor riches,</hi> that both riches and poverty come from God, who gives leſſe unto ſome, and more unto others, of his free-gift. God had enough to have given enough unto all, that all might have been rich, and none poor. <hi>For the earth is the Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1.</note> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>and all that therein is;</hi>

Theſe God will call to a fearfull account at the day of judgement, for abuſing, waſting, and miſpending his gifts. And in the mean time, God many times ſuffers them to want that which they have careleſly waſted, that they may ſee their fault what it is to waſte by their want of it. I have read of a Duke in another Countrey, who ſeeing through his window a company of young Gallants that were a hunting, and ridde up and down over the corn-fields, and tread down the corn, he ſent to bid them the next day to dine with him. And when they were come, he made them great cheere, but took order that no bread except a manchet
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118276:86"/>for himſelfe ſhould be ſet on the Table. One of the Gallants ſpake to a Servitour, to bring in ſome bread, he went out as if he would fetch ſome, but came not again; another ſpake to another, who likewiſe went out, but came in no more: at laſt they told the Duke, that they wanted bread, And well ſaith the Duke, do ye deſerve to want bread with your meat, who ſo trampled down the corn under your horſe-feet. And thus doth God many times deal with thoſe that do waſte his bleſſings, cauſing them to want what they have formerly waſted, as the Prodigall did. Yet many that live waſtefully will excuſe themſelves, and think their fault the leſſe, both becauſe (as they will ſay) they have enough to ſpend, and are able to do it, and becauſe it is their own, and not anothers which they ſpend. But will this excuſe them? Though thou haſt enough, mayeſt thou therefore uſe it at thy pleaſure, and is it no fault to waſte and miſpend it? If thy Cook that dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thy meat for thee, becauſe thou alloweſt him to have ſalt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough alwayes lying by him, ſhould therefore put too much ſalt in the pot, or caſt too much on thy meat, and when thou reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him, he ſhould excuſe himſelfe, and ſay that he did it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſalt enough, and therefore need not to ſpare, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou take this for a ſufficient anſwer? And will God take this as an anſwer from thee, That becauſe that he hath given thee enough, thou mayeſt ſpend it waſtefully, and though it were thine own (as indeed it is not, for thou art but a ſteward to uſe what thou haſt as God hath appointed) yet if it were thine own and not anothers, mayeſt thou therefore miſpend it as thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt? mayeſt thou not ſay as well that thy tongue is thine own, and mayeſt thou therefore ſpeak what thou liſteſt? but as thou ſhalt anſwer for the words which thou ſpeakeſt, ſo for the goods which thou ſpendeſt, becauſe thereby thou doeſt wrong unto him who is the giver of them.</p>

               </hi> in regard of whom all the reſt were but naturals, confutes them all by his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for <hi>David</hi> here, that lived in more true pleaſure then the beſt of them, that had more riches then any of them, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then all of them, he leaves all theſe, and aſcribes felicity in the firſt and ſecond <hi>verſes</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> to the pardon of ſin, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is he Whoſe wickedneſſe is forgiven, and whoſe finis cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

            </p>
            <p>Now as a cunning and skilfull builder, if he have, any goodly building in hand, he will be ſure to lay a very ſound foundation: So <hi>David</hi> here having ſo weighty a Doctrine to inſtruct us in, as <hi>the felicity of man,</hi> he grounds the ſame upon a very excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a reaſon drawn from his ovvn experience, becauſe he found himſelfe to be moſt miſerable and wretched till his ſins were pardoned. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he in the third and fourth <hi>verſes) while I held my tongue, my bones conſumed ſo that I roared all the day long, for thy hand was heavy upon me day and night, and my moiſture was turned into the drought of ſummer.</hi> Whereby he ſhews, That while he plai'd the hypocrite, and cloaked his ſin, while he held his tongue agagg'd as it were his own conſcience that he might not confeſſe his ſin, what a coile God had with him, how he was fain to lay him as it were upon the rack, and to ſtretch him aſunder almoſt every joynt from other, before he could bring him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his ſin, and to ask for pardon. And this was the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which <hi>David</hi> was in while he continued in ſin. Then in the fift <hi>verſe</hi> he ſhews how he was freed and delivered from this miſery, and that is by the confeſſion and acknowledgement of his ſin, <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will confeſſe my ſin, and thou forgaveſt me the puniſhment thereof. Dixi confitebor,</hi> I did but ſay, or I had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>I will confeſſe my ſin, but thou O Lord that mighteſt have taken me at the vantage, and condemned me out of mine owne mouth, thou forgaveſt me the puniſhment of my ſin.</hi> Whereupon being ſtruck with admiration of Gods mercy, he infers in this ſixt <hi>verſe</hi> a notable conſequence out of the former Doctrine, That ſeeing he had ſped ſo well by the confeſſion of his ſin, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:118276:87"/>others ſhould be moved by his example, to do as he did, and to obtain pardon. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall every one that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray unto thee,</hi> therefore, wherefore? why becauſe thou haſt been ſo gracious unto me that was ſo grievous a ſinner, becauſe thou haſt met me as it were in thy mid-way with thy mercy, ſo that I could no ſooner think to confeſſe my ſin, but thou likewiſe thoughteſt to forgive me my ſin: therefore ſhall every godly man though he have committed never ſo many ſins againſt thee, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by my example, to pray unto thee. And thus we ſee the coherence of theſe words with the former.</p>
            <p>In the words for order we may obſerve theſe four things.<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note>

            <p>Firſt, The reaſon why men ſhall come unto God, implyed in this firſt word <hi>therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The perſons that ſhall come unto him, <hi>every one that is godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The manner how they ſhall come, namely, <hi>by praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly the time when they ſhall come unto him, <hi>in a time When he may be found. Therefore ſhall every one that is godly, pray unto thee in a time when thou mayeſt be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, for the reaſon why men ſhall come unto God, the reaſon is drawn from <hi>Davids</hi> own example, as if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid thus, As I did to obtain mercy when I had ſinned againſt God, ſo ſhall every godly man do, but I did pray unto God in a time when he might be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. <hi>Therfore ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thecin a time when thou mayeſt be found.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> alledges his own example, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to come with conſidence to God for the pardon of our ſins, though we have been never ſo hainous ſinners. And from hence we may learn, <hi>That it is our duty to uſe well the examples of others, and to apply Gods dealing with them to our ſelves. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the holy men of God ſet their examples before our eyes, that we might be bettered by their experience.</hi> For as they which firſt ſailed over the ſeas, gave proper names unto dangerous places, where they themſelves hardly eſcaped with their lives, as the Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the Lavander-bed, with other like names beſt known unto Saylers: And as wain-men uſe to ſet up ſome buſh, or other like marke where their waggons ſtuck faſt, for a caveat to them that ſhould come after them. So have the holy men of God furthered us in the <hi>Scripture</hi> by their experience, and taught us to eſchew many incumbrances, which they could not ſo eaſily ſee and avoid, becauſe they broke the ice firſt themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:118276:88"/>
            <p>The whole Scripture is written for our inſtruction, and there is not ſo much as one example in the whole book of God, but a man may make excellent uſe of it, if he will apply it unto himſelf. For to what end are there ſet down in the Scripture ſo many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of the judgements of God upon unrepentant ſinners; but that their examples might be a bridle to us, to reſtraine us from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the like ſinnes for feare we undergo the ſelf ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When we read? of the rich-man that is tormented in hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not relieve poor <hi>Lazarus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 16.</note> are we not to apply this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to our ſelves, that if God have given us wealth and riches, and yet we will not relieve thoſe that are in want &amp; neceſſity; the like judgement will befall us which befell him.</p>
            <p>When we reade of that unmercifull Servant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note> who when his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had forgiven him ten thouſand talents, he afterwards meeting with a fellow-ſervant of his that ought him but an hundred pence, demanded it of him, and becauſe he was not of ability to pay the debt, <hi>he tooke him by the throate and haled him to priſon,</hi> and that the Maſter when he heard thereof was ſo incenſt againſt him, that he demanded againe the ten thouſand talents (which before he had forgiven him) even to the utmoſt farthing; when we read this I ſay, we are to apply the ſame to our ſelves, that if we will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe that have offended us, no more will God forgive us if we offend him. And this uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, to make of theſe examples of Gods judgements upon ſinners. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where having ſpoken of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that periſhed in the wilderneſſe, <hi>They</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are examples to us, to the intent that we ſhould not Iuſt after evill things as they did,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>and periſh in the wilderneſſe three and twenty thouſand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, when we read in the Scripture of Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mercies toward repentant ſinners, as here we have a notable example of Gods mercy upon <hi>David,</hi> who having committed two heinious ſins, adultery and murther; yet as ſoon as God ſaw him ready to confeſſe himſelf guilty, and to acknowledge his ſinne, God did preſently forgive him, are we not to make this uſe hereof, that if we with <hi>David</hi> will acknowledge our ſinne, God will be as ready to forgive us as he forgave him?</p>
            <p>When we read of the poor <hi>Publican Luke</hi> 18. who being true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled with the ſight of his ſinnes, went into the Temple and prayed unto God, <hi>O God be mercifmll to me a finner,</hi> and that he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118276:88"/>went away juſtified, are we not to make this uſe thereof, that if we will humble our ſelves, and acknowledge our ſinne, God will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forgive us as he forgave this <hi>Publican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, when we read of the young unthrift in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</note> who though he had left his Father and his Country, though he had ſpent his patrimony and that very lewdly; yet after that he repented and returu'd to his Father, his Father went out to meet him, fell on his neck and kiſſed him, and was ſo joyfull for his ſonnes return, that he never expoſtulated why he had left him, he never demanded how he had ſpent his portion; but forgetting all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lewd behaviour he received him as gladly as if he had never offended him, are we not to make this uſe thereof, that though we hvae rurme riot with the Prodigal, and lived never ſo lewdly; yet if we will repent &amp; returne unto God he will receive us into favour, as he did this Prodigall? For theſe things are written for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that we might apply the ſame to ourſelves and find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them. That as they among the Heathen, who had been cured of any grievous ſicknes, ſet down in the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> their names &amp; diſeaſes, &amp; the means of their recovery, that if others fel in to the like ſicknes, they might uſe the ſame means which others had done, &amp; recover their health: So have Gods Secretaries the pen-men of the Scriptures inſtructed us therein by their own examples. They have not been tender of their own credits, but have Chronicled and Regiſtred their own ſins and infirmities to remain as it were upon the file unto all poſterities, to the intent that we obſerving both how they fell and were afterwards reſtored, might learne when we are fallen into any ſinne, to do as they did, and obtaine pardon. For what ſinne is it that thou canſt poſſibly fall into, but ſome of Gods children have already fallen into the ſame before thee? If thou ſai'ſt thou haſt lived riotouſly and luxuriouſly, the Prodigall will preſently ſtep forth and tell thee, that he alſo once laboured of the ſame diſeaſe, he lived as riotouſly as ever did any; yet after that he repented and returned to his Father, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour. If thou ſaieſt, that thou haſt been a perſecutor of the godly, <hi>Paul</hi> will comfort thee by his example. If thou ſaieſt thou haſt denyed Chriſt, though it were with perjury, <hi>Peter</hi> will lay his example before thee. If thou ſaieſt that thou art fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a relaps ſince thou wert a Profeſſor of Religion, and ſince thou haſt beene enlightned by the Word of Truth,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118276:89"/>why and I ſaith <hi>David,</hi> was in the very ſame caſe, all the World knows that I committed both adultery and murder, long after I had been a principall profeſſour.</p>
            <p>Now what a glorious viſitation of a ſick ſoul is this, when all the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who have all of them been ſubject to the like infirmities, ſhall come to viſite thee, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about thy bed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort thee, ſhall every one of them tell thee, that his life for thine, though thy ſoul be ſick to the death by reaſon of thy ſin, though the arrow-head of deſpair begin to rancle in thy bowels, and thou be ready to deſpair of thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet that it is impoſſible but that their examples, which are as it were ſo many preſervatives of the Holy Ghoſts own compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, muſt needs do thee good, if thou wilt apply them, and if thou wilt uſe the ſelf-ſame means for thy recovery which they have done. For therefore hath <hi>David</hi> propounded his example unto thee, and ſaith, <hi>That therefore every one that is godly ſhall pray unto God, becauſe he had prayed unto God, and had obtained mercy.</hi> And thus much for the reaſon, <hi>why men ſhould come unto God for pardon?</hi> implyed, as we have heard, in this word <hi>therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which is here mentioned, are <hi>who they be that ſhall come unto God? every one that is godly.</hi> Where we ſee who they be, that make good uſe of theſe examples, <hi>not the wicked, but the godly.</hi> For, as for the wicked, as they pervert the uſe of all things, ſo they abuſe the examples of Gods mercies, <hi>and turn the grace of God into wantonneſſe.</hi> When they hear that <hi>David</hi> and others have fallen ſometimes into grievous ſins, and that God did pardon them, they will challenge to themſelves the more liberty to ſin by their examples: as if <hi>David's</hi> being once overtaken with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvere an excuſe for adulterers, and <hi>Noah's</hi> being once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with vvine, were a warrant for drunkenneſſe. For they will argue thus with themſelves, <hi>David</hi> committed adultery, and yet <hi>David</hi> was ſaved, <hi>Peter</hi> for-ſwore himſelfe, and yet <hi>Peter</hi> was ſaved, <hi>Moſes</hi> was guilty of murder, <hi>Paul</hi> vvas a perſecutor, the prodigall childe lived in riot and pleaſure, and yet all theſe vvere ſaved; and therefore why may not I live riotouſly? why may not I ſwear and for-ſwear myſelfe? vvhy may not I commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, or murder? why may not I venture upon any ſin vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and yet be ſaved as well as they? Thus they incourage themſelves to ſin their examples. So vve read of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, that having committed a bloudy fact, he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118276:89"/>by the example of <hi>David,</hi> but Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reproved the Emperour for it, <hi>Secutus es errantem ſequere paenitentom,</hi> Thou haſt followed him in ſinning, follow him repenting: for their falls are regiſtied to keep us from falling. And therefore the godly will make excellent uſes of theſe mens falls.</p>
            <p>As firſt, To corſider our great weakneſſe in <hi>that the beſt and moſt ſanctified children of God have fallen ſometimes into grievous ſins.</hi> For even <hi>David</hi> that was ſo holy a man,<note place="margin">Maximi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catores opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> that vvas furniſh'd with ſuch extraordinary gifts and graces, yet he himſelfe fell into adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murder. So <hi>Lot though his righteous ſoule was vexed with the uncleanneſſe of the Sodomites, yet he ſell into inceſt with his own daughters. So Noah though he were a juſt man, and perfect in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, was over-taken with drunkenneſſe, and was drowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with wine, after he had ſeen the drowning of the world with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> I might inſtance in others, and therefore when vve hear how they fell, their very falls as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith may ſerve to inſtruct us, <hi>Inſtruct unt Patriarchae non ſolum docentes, ſed etiam errantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, we may learn by their falls (as I ſaid before) to conſider our weakneſſes, how prone we are to fall into any ſin whatſoever, if God by his grace do not continually uphold us. For even as a young infant, long as the Nurſe ſets it down upon the ground, and holds it up with her hand, it will ſtand upright, but if ſhe take aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er hand never ſo little from it, it will preſently fall of it's own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: So it is with us, and the beſt of Gods children, all the while that God doth ſtrengthen and uphold us, we are inabled to ſtand, but if God do but withdraw his aſſiſtance from us, if he leave us to our ſelves never ſo little, we are prone to fall into ſome grievous ſins, as <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others have done. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we are to work out our ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as knowing that though we now ſtand, yet ſuch is the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſſe of our nature, that we may fall hereafter. And this uſe the Apoſtle teacheth us to make, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">

Wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, in the 12th. <hi>verſe) let him that thinks that he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Let him take
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118276:90"/>heed leſt he fall. Why? Why, becauſe that which was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the ſame may be thine, and therefore when thou heareſt how they fell, take heed by their example, left thou fall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and be more watchfull and vigilant overthy ſelfe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the weakneſſe and frailty of thy nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly when the godly hear, how the beſt have fallen into grievousſins, it will teach them <hi>to beware of judging raſhly of thoſe who fall into the like ſins, that they are therefore reprobates, and not of the number of Gods elect.</hi> For thus we ought not to judge of any whatſoever they be, whether they be yet converted or not. Many live vvickedly before their converſion, and follow the luſts of their hearts with all greedineſſe, who nevertheleſſe through Gods mercy are afterwards converted and called to grace as <hi>Paul, Mary Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>the theefe on the Croſſe.</hi> Others again, God ſuffers even after their converſion, and when they have been effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called to grace, to fall as it were into a relapſe, and to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute themſelves with ſome horrible ſins, as <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done, and yet hath reclaimed them and renewed them by repentance. And therefore vve are not to judge of any by reaſon of their ſins, that they are not pertaining to Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe whatſoever their ſins be, or vvhenſoever they ſin, yet God may either convert or renue them, as <hi>David</hi> here was renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theſe uſes the godly will make of his fall, and many other, and therefore he propounds this example to them, <hi>Therefore</hi> (faith he) <hi>ſhall every godly man.</hi> And ſo leaving the perſons, who through
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118276:90"/>his example ſhall come unto God. I come to the manner how they ſhall come unto him, and that is by prayer, <hi>Every one that is godly ſhall pray unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where we ſee both the neceſſity of this duty, <hi>Every one that is godly ſhall pray,</hi> and ſo it is not left unto us as indifferent and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary whether we will pray or no; and the object of prayer, and that is God, <hi>ſhall pray unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The neceſſity of prayer may appear by this, in that it is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely commended in the Scripture without any ſimitation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the perſons, time, or place.<note place="margin">Neceſſity of prayer.</note> That there is no time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from praying, the Apoſtle ſhews <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. where having forewarned us what mighty enemies do ſtand againſt us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.</note> that we do not wreſtle againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, and the Prince of darkneſſe; he therefore wills us, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. <hi>to pray continually with all manner of ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prayers.</hi> So that there is no time when we are not to pray. That there is no perſon exempted from praying, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> ſhews us both by making this a note of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. <hi>That they call not upon God;</hi> and ſaying here generally, <hi>Every one that is godly ſhall pray unto thee.</hi> And that there is no place exempted from praying, the Apoſtle ſhews us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. where he wills us <hi>to pray in every place;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</note> ſo that praying muſt needs be a very neceſſary duty, becauſe it is ſo generally and ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injoyn'd us. Faſting is a duty which is much commended in the Word of God, yet faſting hath his limitation of time; for there is a time when we are not bound to faſt, &amp; therfore our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his Diſciples for not faſting, by an argument drawn from the time. <hi>Can the children of the Bride-chamber faſt while the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom is with them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15.</note> 
               <hi>as long as they have the Bridegroom with them they cannot faſt.</hi> Giving of almes is another duty, which is much commended in the <hi>Scripture</hi> unto us, yet giving of almes hath a limitation of perſons; for all are not injoyn'd to give almes, but onely ſuch as are of ability, and they that are of ability are not injoyned to give almes unto all, but onely to ſuch as are in want and neceſſity; but as every one is injoyn'd to pray, ſo to pray for all men, <hi>I exhort</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>that ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.</hi> So that if we put all theſe together, That every one is injoyn'd to pray, to pray for all perſons, to pray at all times, to pray in all places, and to pray with all manner of ſupplications and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118276:91"/>prayers; This muſt needs be a very neceſſary duty, becauſe it is ſo generally and abſolutely injoyn'd us.</p>
            <p>And indeed, there is great reaſon why prayer ſhould have no limitation, becauſe every man may eaſily performe the ſame. If God had commanded us to offer goats and bullocks unto him, the poore and the needy might have excuſed themſelves for want of ubility; if God had commanded us to go a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage into fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re Countries, and there do him ſervice, the blinde and the lame might have excuſed themſelves, by reaſon of their impotencie. But no man can pretend any juſt excuſe why he ſhould not pray, becauſe every man may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duty. And thus much briefly: for the neceſſity of prayer.</p>
            <p>The Object of prayer,<note place="margin">Object of prayer.</note> ye ſee, is God, <hi>Every one that is godly ſhall pray unto thee.</hi> He doth not ſay, ſhall pray to Saints, or Angels, or the Virgine, but unto thee. For this is the Title which <hi>David</hi> gives unto God, <hi>That he is the hearer of prayer, Pſal.</hi> 65.25. <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> For prayer is a part of Gods ſervice and worſhip, and ſo to be given to no other but God. Therefore God commands us to pray unto him, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> faith God in the fifty <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Chriſt teacheth us to pray unto God. <hi>Our Father, which art in heaven &amp;c.</hi> The Spirit teacheth us to pray unto God. <hi>For God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abba Father.</hi> So that if we would be inſtructed to whom we muſt pray, can we have better inſtructers then theſe, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Gheſt,</hi> who teach us to pray unto God onely? Therefore if we ſearch all over the <hi>Scripture,</hi> from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> among all the prayers which are regiſtred therein, among all the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> one hundred and fifty, whereof two parts at the leaſt are prayers, yet we finde not one prayer among them all, which was ever made to <hi>Cherubin,</hi> or <hi>Seraphim,</hi> to <hi>Raphael, Gabriel,</hi> or any of the <hi>Angebs;</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> or any of the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</hi> to the bleſſed <hi>Virgine,</hi> or any of the <hi>Saints,</hi> but onely to God.</p>
            <p>Thus if we would have preſidents of prayer, can we have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſidents then theſe which the Scripture records, and which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118276:91"/>have been made by the faithfull in all Ages? And the reaſon is plain, becauſe they had no warrant out of Gods word to pray to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other but God; and they knew beſides, that God and no other hears our prayers and ſees our wants.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who pray to Saints and Angels, hold that they cannot but ſee our wants and hear our prayers. For <hi>How</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſhould not they ſee all things who ſea the face of him that ſeeth all things:</hi> as if by ſeeing God they muſt ſee all things that God ſees; which if it were true, their knowledg ye know muſt needs be infinite as God is.</p>
            <p>And beſides, this is plainly confuted by Chriſt, for Chriſt who tells us, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.32.</note> 
               <hi>That the Angells do alwayes behold the face of his Father in Heaven;</hi> He likewiſe tells us, <hi>Marke</hi> 13. <hi>That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells are ignorant of the day of Judgement.</hi> And for the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the Scripture tells us, <hi>That they know no more what is done upon the earth, and have no underſtanding of the affaires of the living.</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. <hi>That the dead know not any thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any more a portion for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eceleſ.</hi> 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>in any thing that is done under the Sunne.</hi> If any of the dead ſhould have any knowledge of the ſtate of the living; then queſtionleſſe Princes of the ſtate of their Subjects, and Fathers of their children; But that Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are departed have not any knowledge of their Subjects, we ſee by <hi>Joſias,</hi> where God gratiouſly promiſes <hi>to take him away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.20.</note> 
               <hi>that he might not ſee the evill which he would bring upon the</hi> Jewes. And that Fathers have no knowledge after their departure of the ſtate of their children; <hi>Job</hi> plainly tells us in his 14. Chapter, the 20. verſe, ſpeaking of a Father that is dead, and leaves children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, <hi>His Sonnes</hi> ſaith he, <hi>come to honour and he knows it not, and they are brought low and he perceives it not.</hi> Nay, <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull, to whom God promiſed, <hi>that he would multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his ſeed as the Starres of Heaven;</hi> yet he had no knowledge after his departure what became of them. And therefore the <hi>Iſraelites Eſay</hi> 63.16. <hi>ver.</hi> acknowledge, <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>that were dead had no knowledge of their miſeries, Doubtleſſe</hi> ſay they, <hi>thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Jacob <hi>know us not, yet thou O Lord art our Father and Redeemer, thy name is for ever. Si tanti Patriarche &amp;c.</hi> If (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) ſo great Patriarchs were ignorant, what became of the people that came from their loines? How ſhall the dead have ought to do in the knowledge or aide of the affaires and actions of their deareſt ſurvivers. But
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118276:92"/>ſuppoſe they did know our affaires and actions, yet our hearts they cannot know; for this is proper to God onely who is the ſearcher of the heart.</p>
            <p>Now our hearts ye know are the ſeate of our prayers, the lips do but vent them to the eares of men. And therefore <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the 1 of the <hi>Kings</hi> the 8. <hi>Chapter,</hi> uſeth this as an argument why we are to pray to no other but God; becauſe God and no other can hear our prayers; becauſe he onely knows our hearts. <hi>Hear thou</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39.</note> 
               <hi>in Heaven thy dwelling place, and do, and give to every man according to his wayes, whoſe heart thou knoweſt; for thou even thou onely knoweſt the hearts of all the children of men.</hi> So that he only is to be prayed unto that can hear our praiers, &amp; he onely can hear them that knows our hearts, and underſtands with what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we pray unto him.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe again, that Saints and Angels could hear our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and did know our hearts; and ſuppoſe that God had put it to our choiſe, whether we would pray to him or to them, have we not more reaſon to pray to him who is the fountaine of grace, then unto them who are but veſſels of grace? Would they be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious as he is unto us? Would they be ſo ready to hear our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? As he commands us to pray unto him: ſo he promiſeth to gives us whatſoever we aske,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 16.23.</note> 
               <hi>Whatſoever</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>ye ſhall aske the Father in my Name, he will give it unto you.</hi> And becauſe of our ſelves we know not how to pray, nor what to aske, he gives us his Spirit to help our infirmitie, and to teach us to pray; <hi>He prepars our hearts</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.</note> 
               <hi>and his eare hearkens thereunto.</hi> And becauſe we are not ſo ready to ask as he would have us he therfore many times prevents our asking, &amp; is more ready to grant our requeſts then we are to make them. So he promiſes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.24. <hi>Antequam clament ego exaudiam. Before they call I will anſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking I will hear.</hi> So he dealt with <hi>David</hi> in this (32) <hi>Pſalme,</hi> who had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>he would confeſſe his ſinne;</hi> but God forgave him. Nay, as he prevents our asking: ſo many times he exceeds our deſires, and gives us more then we aske of him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.13.</note> So he dealt with <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he begged of God, <hi>that he would give him a wiſe and underſtanding heart,</hi> God gave him both that which he did deſire and told him beſides, I <hi>have alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118276:92"/>why we ſhould pray onely to him. And thus much likewiſe for the <hi>Object of prayer,</hi> I now procced unto the laſt point, The time when the godly ſhall come unto God by prayer, nuncly, <hi>

Why, then, ſaith <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>In a time when thou mayeſt be found?</hi> why is there a time when God may not be found? The anſwer is, That there is a time (as the very words imply) when God may not be found, and therefore if we will find God, we muſt come in a time while he may be found. The time when God may not be found, is two-fold. <hi>Tempus impoſſibilitatis,</hi> and <hi>tempus improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitatis.</hi> the time when it is impoſſible to finde him, and the time when it is unlikely to finde him. The time when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to finde him, is when this life is ended. For after this life there is no time for grace, no time for repentence, no time for good works. Therefore it is that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me while it is day, the night comes, and then no man can work:</hi> by day underſtanding the time of this life, and by night, death. <hi>Hie amittitur vita aut recipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur,</hi> ſaith <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>prian.</hi> In this life, the life to come is either loſt or gotten. He that defers the ſeeking thereof till this life be paſt, he knocks with the fooliſh Virgins when the gates are ſhut, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118276:93"/>then it is to late, he that ſeeks not for mercy till after this life, he ſhall find none, no not ſo much as a drop of cold water to coole his tongue. For as the tree falls ſo it lies, and as the day of our death doth leave us: ſo ſhall the day of judgement find us.</p>
            <p>The time when it is unlikely to find God, is when he offers us grace, and we reject the ſame; when he calls us by his Word, and we harden our hearts; and when upon preſumption of the mercy of God whenſoever we repent, we deferr our repentance to the end of our lives, and ſo indeed do never truly repent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Counſell is very good, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 5.7. <hi>Make no tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to turn unto the Lord, and put it not off from day to day; for ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall the wrath of God break forth, and in thy ſecurity thou ſhalt be deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as there is a time when God may not be found: ſo there is a time when he may be found; &amp; this time is likewiſe twofold, either more common and generall, or more proper and ſpeciall. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and generall time when God may be found, is this whole life time, from the beginning of our life till the end thereof. And therefore if we muſt come unto God while he may be found, and he may be found this whole life time, <hi>then we cannot begin to ſoone to come unto him.</hi> Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> counſells us, to <hi>remember our Creator in the dayes of our youth,</hi> that ſo we may be ſeaſoned with godlineſſe, and Religion in the beginning of our life.</p>
            <p>The more ſpeciall time when God may be found, is when he cals us unto him by the preaching of the word; for then he offers his grace unto us, and knocks by his Spirit at the doore of our hearts, that he may have entrance. If we open unto him, he will ſay to our ſouls, here will I dwell for I have a delight herein; but if we refuſe to give him entrance, if we harden our hearts when we hear his voice, we know not when, whether ever or never he will come againe.</p>
            <p>And therefore to conclude with the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation;</hi> And therefore if thou wilt come unto him in the time accepted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not the time; but come unto him while ſalvation is offered. The time that is paſt is altogether irrevocable, the time that is to come is altogether uncertaine, onely the time preſent, is the time accepted; and therefore come now while he may be found.</p>

               <hi>Stevens</hi> great piety in his martyrdom, is ſet down more largely in the words following; and herein is declared both his faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and his charity towards men: both which he ſhews by a double prayer which he makes; firſt for himſelf, He called upon God ſaying. <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit;</hi> then for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>he kneeled down and cryed with a loud voice, Lord lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi>

            <p>Firſt then concerning the impiety of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> the perſon that was martyred here was <hi>Steven,</hi> who according to his name, which in the Greek doth ſignifie a Crown, was the firſt, who after the Aſcention of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Sorts of Martyrs.</note> was crowned with martyrdom. Now there are Martyrs of three ſorts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, Such as are Martyrs <hi>(voluntate ſed non opere)</hi> in will and deſire, but not in act. So <hi>Euſebius</hi> vvrites of <hi>Origen,</hi> that while he vvas young, he had ſuch a deſire to be a Martyr, that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was faine to hide all his apparel that ſhe might keep him at home: becauſe otherwiſe he vvould have gone to his Father, who vvas then in priſon, to have ſuffered martyrdom vvith him. And ſo he was a Martyr in vvill and affection.</p>
            <p>And it is very memorable, vvhich <hi>Sotrates, Theodoret</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe <hi>Sozomen</hi> in their Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, do report of a woman vvho ſo affected martyrdom, that vvhen ſhe underſtood that <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, had ſent <hi>Modeſtus</hi> the Governour of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> with a band of ſouldiers to kill all the Chriſtians, that were aſſembled there at St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Church, ſhe ran thither in all haſt with a child of hers; <hi>Modeſtus</hi> obſerving how faſt ſhe ran, cauſed her to be called, and asked her <hi>whether ſhe was running?</hi> She anſwered, to the Church vvhere the Chriſtians were aſſembled, <hi>Why, do you not know</hi> ſaith <hi>Modeſtus, that the Emperour hath ſent me thither to put them all to death?</hi> I know it well, ſaith the woman, and therefore I make the more haſt thither that I may dye with them. <hi>But why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do you carry your child with you?</hi> That he, ſaith ſhe, may likewiſe be crowned vvith Martyrdom. This anſwer of hers, ſo moved <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtus,</hi> that he returned back, and diſwaded the <hi>Emperour</hi> from the execution of it. And theſe vvere Martyrs in vvill and affection, but not in act.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, There are others, that are (<hi>Martyres opere ſed non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate</hi> Martyrs in act but not in vvill and affection. Such were thoſe innocent babes of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> that <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew, vvhom St <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> calls <hi>Primitias Martyrum,</hi> the firſt fruits of Martyrs; for theſe dyed for Chriſt that vvas to dye for them, and vvere Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes unto him, ſpeaking vvith their bloud (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith) that could not ſpeak vvith their tongue, and confeſſing and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his praiſe, not in ſpeaking, but in dying. And ſuch a Martyr vvas that babe, vvhereof we read in the book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> vvhich ſprang out of his Mothers Wombe while ſhe was burning at the ſtake, and vvas by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> caſt againe into the fire, as thy
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118276:94"/>brood of Heriticks. A more horrible and impious act in them then it had been being committed by any other, in regard of their doctrine; becauſe they hold it as an Article of their Faith, that all Children are damned that dye without Baptiſme; and yet they vvilfully burned this innocent before he vvas Baptized, and ſo (as they thought) did not onely caſt his Body into the fire; but his Soule into Hell: though indeede this bleſſed Babe did not want Baptiſme, but vvas Baptized vvith the Holy Ghoſt, and vvith fire; and vvas no ſooner borne, but died a <hi>Martyr, (Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr opere non voluntate) a Martyr</hi> in act though not in vvill and deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, There are others, that are <hi>(Martyres voluntate et ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) Martyrs</hi> both in Will and Act; and ſuch a <hi>Martyr</hi> vvas <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> vvho both in Will and Act did ſuffer <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, becauſe as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith out of <hi>Cyprian (Non paena ſed cauſa facit Martyrem)</hi> it is not the puniſhment vvhich a man doth ſuffer, but the cauſe for vvhich he ſuffers, that makes him a <hi>Martyr.</hi> Let us ſee for what it vvas that <hi>Steven</hi> vvas here Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this vvas (as vve ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 52.) for the Teſtimony of Chriſt. <hi>Which of the Prophets,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have not your Fathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted? And they have ſlaine them, which ſhewed before of the coming of the juſt One, of whom you have been now the betrayers and murtherers.</hi> He knevv that they hated Chriſt to the death, and had therefore Crucified him; He knevv that they had impriſoned his Diſciples, and ſtrictly charged them to Preach no more in his Name; He knevv that for Preaching in his Name he himſelf vvas here brought before the Councell, and had falſe Witneſſes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned againſt him, and ſo could not but knovv that his bearing vvitneſſe to Chriſt muſt needs endanger him; and yet vvith great boldneſſe he bear vvitneſſe to Chriſt; and for this it vvas that he ſuffered Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>Here then, in <hi>Steven</hi> we may obſerve a difference betvven true and falſe Martyrs. True Martyrs ſuffer in a good cauſe, for the teſtimony of Chriſt and the defence of the truth: but falſe Martyrs ſuffer in a bad cauſe, for the defence of their errors.<note place="margin">Epipha. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Har. lib. <hi>3.</hi> to <hi>2.</hi> Har. <hi>80.</hi>
               </note> So <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writes of a ſect called <hi>Martyriani,</hi> vvho count themſelves Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs though they ſuffred indeed for their vvorſhiping of Idols.</p>
            <p>So many have been regiſtred for Martyrs, and canonized for Saints, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that have ſuffered as Traitors, and died for Treaſon But true Martyrs do ſuffer in a juſt cauſe, and

               </note> but <hi>that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake.</hi> This was that which made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo willing to ſuffer, that being fore-told by <hi>Agabus, Acts</hi> 21. <hi>That at Jeruſalem he ſhould be in bonds, and be delivered into the hands of the Gentiles,</hi> and being therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by the brethren that,<note place="margin">

And ſo leaving the firſt point, <hi>the perſon that was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd,</hi> I come to the ſecond, <hi>the kind of his Martyrdome,</hi> and that was ſtoning. <hi>They ſtoned Steven.</hi>
            </p>

               </note> Saint <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple that Chriſt loved, was condemned to baniſhment by the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> &amp; was baniſhed into the Iſle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> where he wrote the Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Diſciple that loved Chriſt, was condemned by <hi>Nero</hi> to be crucified, and was hanged on the Croſſe (as Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> writes) with his head down-wards, affirming himſelfe unworthy to be crucified in the ſame manner that his Lord was. Saint <hi>Andrew, Peters</hi> brother, was likewiſe crucified, imbracing the Croſſe, (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Per te me recipiat, qui per te me redemit,</hi> Let him receive me by thee, who by thee redeemed me: and hanging on the Croſſe three dayes before he died, converted many in the mean time to Chriſt, Saint <hi>James</hi> the elder, the Son of <hi>Zebedec,</hi> and Saint
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118276:95"/>
               <hi>Johns</hi> brother, was killed with the ſword; and the perſon (as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> writes) that had accuſed him, when he ſaw him condemned, was ſo moved therewith, that he profeſt himſelf to be a Chriſtian, and having asked forgiveneſſe of Saint <hi>James,</hi> was beheaded with him. Saint <hi>James</hi> the younger, the ſon of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe he would not deny Chriſt to be the Son of God, was thrown down headlong from the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements of the Temple, and being ſtill alive, though both his thighes were broke, his braines were daſhed out (as <hi>Egeſippus</hi> writes) with a Fullers club. Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> who would not believe that Chriſt was riſen from the dead, except he might put his hand into the wound which the launce had made, was afterwards in <hi>India</hi> (as ſome Authours report) thruſt through with a launce, becauſe he would not worſhip the image of the Sun, which was worſhipt by them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was beheaded in <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Nero,</hi> on the ſame day (as ſome do write) that <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified, and ſo that may not unfitly be applied to them, which <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan, They were lovely in their lives, and in their deaths they were not devided.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.23.</note> I might further inſtance in the reſt of the Apoſtles, and in the bloudy perſecutions which afterwards followed, wherein there was made ſuch havock of the Church, that if <hi>Ievemie,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> had lived in thoſe dayes, there had been matter for the one to have made new Lamentations, and for the other to ſit weeping by the walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he remembred <hi>Sion.</hi> Thus in theſe was verefied what our Saviour fore-told, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſecution which they were to ſuffer; and the firſt of them all, which brake, as it were, the ice, and led the way to the reſt, was <hi>Steven</hi> here, <hi>who was ſtoned to death.</hi> A kind of death which was appointed by God, for idolaters, blaſphemers, and malefactors, that others ſeeing what puniſhment they ſuffered, might be kept from committing the like ſins, for fear of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the like puniſhment. So we ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>That the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that inticed the people to ſerve other gods,</hi>

Here then we may obſerve from the kind of his Martyrdome, which was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118276:96"/>ſtoning, <hi>That we are not to judge of a man by the kind of his death, becauſe ſometimes the godly die the ſame kind of death that the wicked do.</hi>

The like may be ſaid of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> a good Son of a bad Father, yet both of them ſlain in the field together. So ſeditious <hi>Sheba</hi> that conſpired againſt <hi>David,</hi> died the ſame kind of death that <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> did, for they were both beheaded: and <hi>Steven</hi> here dyed the ſame kind of death that <hi>Achan</hi> did, for they were both ſtoned.</p>

               </label> In a vvord, <hi>There is hardly any death that can be names, but ſome of the godly have been put thereunto as well as the wicked.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve are not to judge of any by the kind of his death, that he died vvell or ill; becauſe that kind of death vvhich befalls one, may befall an other.

            <p>It vvas a fearfull kind a death which <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> died, both for the ſuddenneſſe and violence of it, who fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling great anguiſh in all his nerves, was, by the advice of his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, to be cloſe wrapped in linnen cloth, which had been well ſteeped in <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and the cloth to be ſowed ſtrait all about his body: one having ſowed it, not having a knife ready to cut the thread, took the candle to burn the thread in ſunder, and the thread flaming to the cloth took ſudden hold of the ſame, and the <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> that the King in this flame was burnt to death, before he could be helped by any. And many come to ſuch fearfull ends, and yet we cannot judge of them by the kind of their death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe even the godly, whoſe death is precious in the eyes of the Lord howſoever they die, do ſometimes die a violent death, and that ſuddenly: So did old <hi>Eli</hi> that was a good man; vvho <hi>hearing that the Arke of God was taken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18.</note> 
               <hi>fell backward from his ſcate, his neck

For we do not know, by what kinde of death we ſhall glorifie God, whether we ſhall die an eaſie or a painfull death, whether a naturall or a violent death, whether a lingring or a ſudden death.</p>
            <p>The times have been, (God grant the like times may never come again) when there have been ſo great perſecutions in the Church, that the faithfull have been put to all manner of deaths: whether God hath reſerved us to the like times or no we do not know, we know we have no promiſe to the contrary; and therefore ought to prepare our ſelves for the like times, that if they come, we may conſtantly maintain the profeſſion of Chriſt, though it coſt us our lives, as here it did <hi>Steven.</hi> And thus much likewiſe for the ſecond point the kinde of his martyrdom.

But as for the <hi>Iewes</hi> he firſt taught them himſelf, and delivered them his Law from his own mouth: and becauſe they deſired to be inſtructed rather by men like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore ſpake to <hi>Moſes, Loquere tu nobiſcum et audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emus &amp;c.

They were not the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or any Heatheniſh people that knew not God, for then their ſin had been the leſs; but they were the <hi>Jewes</hi> Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen people, who commonly if they were offended with any, upon every occaſion were ready to ſtone them.

And this vvas a greater ſin in them, being the people of God, then if they had been heathen, The heathen ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt them, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced their Prieſts though they were Idolaters.

Nay the greater extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and danger they are in, God inables them to pray with the more fervency unto him. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did never pray more fervently then when the ſentence of death was pronounced againſt him, and he lay a dying. <hi>I beſeech thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>O Lord remember now how I have walked before thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, now O Lord when I am ready to die, and no other can ſuccour me,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.3.</note> now when Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and art do faile me, now when my ſtrength is diminiſhed and nature decayed, now when thou haſt pronounced the ſentence of death againſt me, now O Lord, now, now remember me.

            <p>He called upon God, ſaying, <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> which invicibly proves, that Chriſt is God.

But the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not more plain in any thing then it is in this.

            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> do commonly at their death commend their ſouls to the Virgine <hi>Mary.</hi> So did Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> &amp; ſo did <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> two that are reputed for ſpeciall <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they ſuffered for treaſon, they commended their ſoules at the time of their death to the bleſſed Virgine. And it is a common prayer among them, <hi>Maria mater gratiae, tu nos ab hoſte protege, &amp; hora mortis ſuſcipe. Mary</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of grace, do thou defend us from the enemy, and receive us at the hour of death. But <hi>Steven</hi> here the firſt Martyr, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his ſoule to the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> when he died, but to Chriſt that redeemed it, <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>receive my ſpirit.</hi> And he joyns theſe two Lord Jeſus, together, acknowledging Chriſt to be both, both his Lord and his Saviour. Some disjoyne theſe, they will acknowledge Chriſt to be their <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they vvill ſay they look to be ſaved by him, but they do not acknowledge him for their <hi>Lord,</hi> they will not ſerve him. Such are they who go on in their ſins, and follow the luſts of their own hearts, and yet do look to be ſaved by grace. But ſuch do greatly deceive themſelves. For either Chriſt will be our <hi>Lord,</hi> or he will be our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we muſt be content to yield him obedience, and to live as becomes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or he will not ſave us. And therefore only the godly that ſerve him in their life, can with comfort commend their ſouls unto him at the time of their death, and ſay as <hi>Steven</hi> did, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He prayes not for his body, but for his ſoule. Though it were his body which was here in danger, while the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtoning him, yet it is not his body, but it is his ſoule that he prayes for, as being more ſenſible of his future eſtate then of his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not ſo much regarding this preſent life, as the life to come. Many in their life, and at the time of their death, are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:118276:99"/>carefull for their bodies, thinking of the great pain which their bodies are to ſuffer when death ſiezes upon them, and taking care how they ſhall be able to overcome the ſame. This care troubles many that are good Chriſtians, who are the more afraid of death for the pain thereof, and imagine the pain to be greater then it is. That death is painfull there is not any queſtion, <hi>Si nulla eſſet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis amaritudo, non magna eſſet martyrum fortitudo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> If there were no ſharpneſſe and pain in death, it were no great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the <hi>Martyrs</hi> to ſuffer it. But though death be painfull, yet we muſt remember this for our comfort, that it will be no more painfull to us, then it hath been to the godly in all ages; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould we be afraid to undergo that, which all the godly have undergone before us? Will not any man be content to be put to that, whereunto the King puts his chiefe Favourites? for he will think with himſelfe, if I be put to no more then the Kings Favourites are, I ſhall fare well enough. The godly, ye know, are Gods chiefe Favourites, God loves and favours them above all others: if therefore they have ſuffered the paine of death, and have not been exempted by God from it, we may well be the leſſe carefull to undergo it, and may aſſure our ſelves, that though the paine were never ſo great, yet Chriſt who hath redeemed both our ſoules and bodies, will inable us to bear it, and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Qui ſemel pro nobis mortem vicit, ſemper vincet in nobis.</hi> He that once overcame death for us, will alwayes overcome it in us. And therefore whether we die for the Lord, or in the Lord, we may well lay the care of our bodies aſide, and may chearfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſoules unto Chriſt, as <hi>Steven</hi> here did, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi>

And we read the like of <hi>David,</hi> that he ſat and prayed. Other kinde of geſtures we uſe in our prayers, which may be reduced unto theſe two heads, ſuch as we uſe in regard of our Hope, or in regard of our Humiliation and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>In regard of our hope, we lift up our eyes, and we ſtretch forth our hands, as expecting and requiring Gods help and aſſiſtance. So <hi>David</hi> in the 121. <hi>Pſalm, I will lift up mine eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> praying for the <hi>Iſracletes Exod.</hi> 17. <hi>That they might prevale againſt Amaleck, he ſtretched forth his hands.</hi> For as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Oculus erectus expectat, manus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſa poſtulat,</hi> The eyes being lift up expect help, and the hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtretcht forth, do ſeeme to reuqire it.</p>
            <p>In regard of our humiliation and reverence, we uncover our heads, we bow down our bodies, and we kneele on our knees, we uncover our heads, which is <hi>Magnificentia depoſitio,</hi> a laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of our greatneſſe. And thus Kings and Princes, when they pray unto God, do uncover their heads laying aſide their ſtate, and acknowledging thereby, that they are Gods Servants: So we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelves and fall down on our knees, as <hi>Steven</hi> here did, in token of the reverence we owe unto God in offering our prayers. And this geſture of kneeling, we finde to have been often uſed by the faithfull, and as the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> (who wrote the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) affirme, hath been the moſt ancient geſture in prayer, and the moſt uſed by the Church in all ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> as we ſee in the 9. of the <hi>Asts,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20. did pray kneeling: ſo did the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in his ſixt <hi>Chapter.</hi> Saint <hi>James</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was ſo frequent in praying on his knees, that he made his knees as hard as the hoofe of a Camel with continuall kneeling. And the like did <hi>Aſella</hi> as we read in St. <hi>Jerome.</hi> It is true indeed, that it is the heart and affection of him that prays, and not the geſture of the body which God reſpects, but withall this is true, that he that makes no conſcience of praying reverently, doth never pray heartily; and he that will not bend the knee unto God, much leſſe out of doubt will he bend the heart. <hi>O come let us Worſhip and fall down,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmeſt, and

And this is the very perfection of love, and an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible argument, that they who can do it, are the children of God.</p>
            <p>A wicked man may performe many Chriſtian duties, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable actions upon by-reſpects; He may give Almes to the poor, that men may think the better of him; he may Faſt, becauſe abſtinence is good for his health; he may abſtaine from adultery, theft, and the like, for the avoiding of ſhame and diſcredit; and he may put up wrongs and not ſeek to be revenged, for fear of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that may follow after it. But for a man to love his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and pray for his perſecutors, this canot be done in any by-reſpect; but muſt needs be the worke of grace in him.</p>
            <p>This is that wherein the godly do moſt reſemble God, in loving their enemies, and rendring good to thoſe that deſerve evill at

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118276:101"/>in truth, in judgement and in righteouſneſſe.</hi> The firſt againſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> who hold it unlawfull to ſwear at all, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear.</hi> The ſecond againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who hold it lawfull to ſwear by the Creatures, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth.</hi> The third againſt all profane ſwearers, that take either falſe or fraudulent Oaths, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in truth,</hi> or inconſiderate or unneceſſary Oaths, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in judgement:</hi> or laſtly pernicious and wicked Oaths, which are taken for the performance of ſome unlawfull action, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in righteouſneſſe.</hi> And theſe are the ſeverall parts of theſe words.</p>
            <p>And firſt, concerning the lawfulneſſe of an Oath, I neede not ſtand long upon the proof thereof; becauſe as the Lawyers ſay, <hi>Quod conſuetum eſt praeſumitur eſſe juſtum,</hi> That is commonly held to be juſt and lawfull which is ordinary and common. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are of another opinion, and would utterly take away the uſe of an Oath, ſomething muſt be ſpoken of the lawfulneſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>That it is lawfull therefore to take an Oath, we may ſee, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By the expreſſe commandement of God. If to take an Oath were ſimply unlawfull,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> then God would not have forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den us, to take his name in vain, but to take it at all, as becauſe it is ſimply unlawfull to ſwear by falſe Gods, he doth not forbid us to take their names in yaine; but abſolutely forbids us to ſwear by them. And as he forbids us to ſwear by them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exo.</hi> 23.13.</note> ſo he commands us to ſwear by him. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him, and thou ſhalt ſwear by his name.</hi> Which words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. with a little addition, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, him ſhalt thou ſerve; thou ſhalt cleave unto him and ſwear by his name.</hi> So that the taking of an Oath, is not left unto us as a thing indifferent; but commanded by God, and that as a part of Gods ſervice and worſhip. And therefore God promiſeth a bleſſing to thoſe that ſwear by his Name,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16.</note> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.16. <hi>It ſhall come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to paſſe, that if they will diligently learne the wayes of my people, to ſweare by my name, The Lord liveth, as they taught my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſwear by</hi> Baal; <hi>then ſhall they be built in the middeſt of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 15.4. <hi>He that ſweareth,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, though it be to his own hinderance, and changeth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall dwell in Gods Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</hi> But if it were unlawfull to ſwear at all, he would not have placed him in Gods Tabernacle, that ſwears and keeps his Oath,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:118276:102"/>though it be to his own hinderance; but rather him that ſweareth not, though it be to his own advantage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the example of thoſe holy men in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> who have taken oathes, and that ſometime publickly. Thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſwore to the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.53.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. And thus <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſwore unto <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the King of the <hi>Philiſtins, Gen.</hi> 26.31. ſometime privately. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> ſwore unto <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi> 31.53. And thus <hi>David</hi> ſware unto <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.17. I might alleadge further the example of Angels, and of God himſelfe, who have taken oathes, and therefore to ſweare is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the end for which an oath was ordained. An oath is a means which God hath appointed for the ending of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and for the deciſion of ſtrife and contention. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith of an oath,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>the end of all ſtrife.</hi> Thus for the determination of doubtfull cauſes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exed.</hi> 22.11.</note> God appointed the Magiſtrate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. to put men to their oathes; and the party ſuſpected having thus taken an oath, was freed and acquitted. And this cuſtome hath prevailed in all Countries. For all men being perſwaded that there is a God from whom nothing is hid, and that he is a lover of truth, and an hater of falſhood, and therefore that he will be revenged upon thoſe that for-ſweare themſelves; hence it is that this cuſtom hath prevailed all over the World, that mens oathes ſhould be taken in doubtfull cauſes, that ſo the truth might be brought to light, and the matter decided.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, that the taking of an oath it not onely permitted, but commanded by God; commanded as a part of Gods ſervice and worſhip, and commanded with the promiſe of a bleſſing <hi>to thoſe that take it.</hi> Seeing it is warranted by the examples of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, who have taken oaths; and ſeeing an oath was ordained by God for ſo excellent an end, as for <hi>the confirmation of the truth,</hi> and <hi>the deciſion of controverſies,</hi> it is plain againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that there is a lawfull uſe of ſwearing. And thus much concerning the lawfulneſſe of oaths. I come now to the object of an oath, or by whom we are to ſwear, by God, and no other, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear, the Lord liveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Heathen</hi> in their oaths were wont to ſwear by all manner of creatures. Some of them were wont to ſwear by themſelves,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118276:102"/>or by ſome part of their body, as <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour uſed to ſwear by his beard, and <hi>Polypheme</hi> the Monſter by his one eye. Some of them were wont to ſwear by others, as the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſwore by dead mens ghoſts, <hi>Caligula</hi> by his ſiſter and wife <hi>Druſilla,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> by the name of <hi>Socrates.</hi> Some ſwore by unreaſonable and ſenceleſſe creatures, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſwore by dogs and goats, the <hi>Germans</hi> ſwore by the names of their horſes, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by their garlick, leeks and onions. But to paſſe them over, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold it lawfull to ſwear by the Creatures. And they alleadge to this purpoſe thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.21. <hi>Whoſoever ſwears by the Temple, ſwears by it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.21.</note> 
               <hi>and by him that dwels therein; and he that ſweareth by Heaven, ſwearth by the Throne of God, and by him that ſits thereon.</hi> From whence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, That ſwearing by the creatures is referred to the honour and glory of God, and therefore that it is lawfull to ſweare by them. But I would aske them this queſtion, Whether Chriſt in thoſe words doth authorize the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſwear by the creatures, and juſtifie their ſwearing by the Temple or by Heaven? If they ſay, he doth not, how do they inferre that God is honoured by their ſwearing by them? If they ſay, he doth, then why doth Chriſt ſay, <hi>Swear not by Heaven, for it is Gods Throne?</hi> for if theſe oaths were lawfull,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34.</note> Chriſt would not have forbidden them, and if they be unlawfull, God is diſhonoured by them. And therefore they cannot inferre from thoſe words, that becauſe while the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſwear by the creatures, they ſwore likewiſe by God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God was honoured by their ſwearing by the creatures, but rather that in ſwearing by them they could not avoid, but they ſwore alſo by God, and therefore diſhonoured him while they counted it nothing to ſwear by them.</p>
            <p>An oath is a part of Gods ſervice and worſhip, and ſo to be directed to no other but God. Therefore God commands (as we heard before) to ſvvear onely by him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, him ſhalt thou ſerve, thou ſhalt cleave unto him, and ſwear by his Name.</hi> And he complaines of the <hi>Jews, Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>That their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had forſaken him, and had ſworn by thoſe which were no Gods:</hi> implying thereby, <hi>That we are to ſwear by God, and no other.</hi> And he threatens <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>That he will cut them off, that ſwear by the Lord, &amp; ſwear by Malcham.</hi> It is a true ſaying, <hi>Quicquid illud eſt, per quod quis jurat, illud deificat.</hi> If we ſwear by any thing, whatſoever it be we deifie the ſame. For an oath is an invocation of the Name of God,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:118276:103"/>as the onely ſearcher of the heart, whereby when we ſwear, we call God to witneſſe that we ſpeak the truth, and wiſh God to puniſh us if we do otherwiſe. So that whatſoever we ſweare by, we attribute unto it theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it knows whether we ſpeak the truth or no, and therefore it is that we call it to witneſſe. So ſaith <hi>Thomas Aquinas, Jurare per Deum nihil alind eſt, quam invocare ejus teſtimonium.</hi> To ſwear by God, is nothing elſe but to call God to witneſſe. So that while we ſwear by any thing, we call it to witneſſe, and ſo attribute the knowledge of the truth untoit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it is able to puniſh us if we ſwear that which is falſe. So ſaith the ſame School-man. <hi>Nihil aliud eſt dicere per Deum ita eſt, niſi quod Deus puniat me, ſi non it a eſt.</hi> It is nothing elſe to ſwear by God that it is ſo, but that God puniſh me if it be not ſo. So that while we ſwear by any thing, we give thus much unto it, That if we ſwear falſe, it is able to puniſh us. But theſe two things are onely proper unto God, and therefore we are to ſwear by no other. Whenſoever then we ſwear by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as either by this light, which was the oath of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> or by the Roode, by the Maſſe, by our Lady, or the like; which as if we wanted oaths of our own, we have borrowed of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> they are all ſuperſtitious and idolatrous oaths. It was decreed by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouncel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that if a Miniſter ſhould ſwear by any creature, he ſhould firſt be ſharply reprehended for it, and if he perſiſted in this vice, he ſhould be excommunicated, becauſe it is an abuſe of Gods holy Name to ſwear by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And therefore <hi>Polycarp,</hi> as we read in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> choſe rather to be torn in pieces by wilde beaſts, as they threatned him at the firſt, or to be burnt at the ſtake, as he was after, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he would prophane the Name of God by ſwearing, as they would have had him, by the fortune of <hi>Caſar.</hi> So hainous a ſinne was it thought by this <hi>Martyr</hi> to ſwear by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That the <hi>Scripture</hi> maketh mention of ſome holy men that have ſworn by the creatures, as that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſwore by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.16. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.16. and that <hi>Etiſha</hi> ſwore by the ſoule of <hi>Eliah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.4.</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, That either they are not oaths, but onely vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obteſtations, as ſome Divines do hold; or if they be oaths, yet becauſe they are contrary to the Word of God, that we are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:118276:103"/>not to imitate their examples: but we may ſay of them as St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Haec quidem in Scripturis ſantis legimus, non ideò tamen quia facta credimus, facienda creáamus, ne duns paſſins ſectamur exempla violemus pracepta.</hi> We read (ſaith he) indeed of ſuch examples in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> not that becauſe we believe they vvere done, we ſhould therefore believe they may lawfully be done, left ſo we violate the commandement of God, vvhile that vve ſeek to imitate the examples of men. But thus much likevviſe for the object of an oath. I come novv to the conditions, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in truth, in judgement, and in righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt condition vvhich is required in an oath, is, <hi>that we ſwear in truth:</hi> God to inflame us the more vvith the love of Truth, is called in the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>John</hi> 15.26.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>the God of Truth.</hi> Our Saviour calls himſelfe <hi>the truth;</hi> the Holy Ghoſt is called <hi>the Spirit of truth;</hi> Gods Word is called <hi>the Scripture of truth,</hi> and his Church is called <hi>the pillar of truth.</hi> To note unto us; <hi>That they who are Members of his Church, they who are inſtructed in his holy Word, they who are led by his holy Spirit, they who are redeemed by his Son, and adopted by God to be his children, they of all others are to ſtand for the truth, to imbrance it in their hearts, to teſtiſie it in their words, and when occaſion requires, to confirme it in their oaths.</hi> And to this end, God hath given us his ſacred Name, as a Seal to ratifie and confirme the truth, that in matters of importance, the truth vvhereof cannot otherwiſe be known but by taking an oath, vve might uſe Gods Name, and call God as a vvitneſſe to the truth of our ſpeech. Whenſoever therefore vve take an oath, vve muſt be ſure that the matter be true vvhich vve ſwear, otherwiſe vve commit a moſt bainous ſin; in calling God as a vvitneſſe to that vvhich is falſe.</p>
            <p>And vvhereas an oath is of two ſorts; either <hi>aſſertory,</hi> of things that vve affirme; or <hi>promiſſory,</hi> of things vvhich vve promiſe to performe: vve muſt be ſure that in them both we do ſwear the truth. For if either vve doubt of the truth of the matter, or have not a full purpoſe to performe our promiſe in taking ſuch an oath, vve for-ſwear our ſelves. There are ſome that vvill make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an <hi>aſſertory oath,</hi> and vvill be ſure they ſweare nothing but that vvhich they know to be the truth; yet for keeping their promiſe they make no great reckoning, though they have bound themſelves by oath for the performance thereof. But every ſingle promiſe, if the thing be lawfull, vvhich a man hath promiſed,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:118276:104"/>doth bind a man; conſcience to the performance of it, and when an Oath is added there is a double bond. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. <hi>That God widing more abundantly to ſhew the ſtable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his counſell to the heirs of promiſe, bound himſelf by an Oath, that ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by two immutable things,</hi> (namely the promiſe which he had made, and the Oath which he had taken) <hi>we might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi> So that taking of an Oath, doth bind a man doubly to the performance of his promiſe. Nay, if that a man have once taken an Oath, though he were induced thereunto by fraud and deceit; yet the thing being lawfull he is bound to performe it. And this we may ſee by the example of that Oath which was made to the <hi>Gibeonites, Joſh.</hi> 9.19. for vvhen <hi>the Gibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nites came craftily to the</hi> Jewes, <hi>as though they had been men of a far country, and had brought them to ſwear that they would not hurt them, and the</hi> Iewes <hi>knew afterwards who they were, and therefore were offended that they ſhould be ſpared; yet</hi> Ioſhua <hi>and the Princes dia ſave their lives, in regard of the oath which they had made unto them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> Saul <hi>afterwards brake this oath by deſtroying the</hi> Gibeonits, <hi>there was a famine in the land for the ſpace of three years; and till ſeven of</hi> Sauls <hi>Sonnes were bang'd for this fact, God was not appeaſed.</hi> So grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a ſinne is the breach of an Oath in the ſight of God. And therefore whenſoever we take an Oath, we muſt alwayes have an eye to this firſt condition, <hi>that we ſwear in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are two things contrary to the truth of an Oath.</p>
            <p>Firſt fraudulent and deceitfull ſwearing, when we take an Oath with an intent to deceive them unto whom we ſweare, pretending one thing and intending another.</p>
            <p>Such an Oath was that which <hi>Cleomenes</hi> took, who having made a truce with his enemies for certaine dayes, in the meane time ſet upon them perfideouſly in the night, pretending that the truce was made onely for the dayes.</p>
            <p>Such an Oath was that which we read of in <hi>Theodoret.</hi> A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child was hired by ſome, to Father her child upon <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch;</hi> The woman being examined and put to her Oath, ſwore that <hi>Euſtathius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> was the Father of it; whereupon the Biſhop was depoſed and baniſht. She after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards falling into grievous ſicknes, confeſſed that ſhe had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accuſed the Biſhop; and yet denied that ſhe was forſworn, becauſe howſoever ſhe pretended the Biſhop, yet ſhe meant it not of him, but of another in the City of the ſame name.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:118276:104"/>
            <p>And ſuch an Oath was that which was taken by <hi>Laſus,</hi> vvhen he had ſtolne a fiſh out of a Fiſh-mongers ſhop, as we ſee in <hi>Atheneus.</hi> For <hi>Laſus</hi> having ſtoln it, &amp; another received it &amp; both denyied it; being both brought before the Magiſtrate &amp; put to their oath,<note place="margin">Athen. deipnos.</note> 
               <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſwore thus; that he neither had it nor knew any other that ſtole it; the other ſwore thus, that he neither ſtole it nor knew any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that had it; becauſe he himſelf had it, and <hi>Laſus</hi> ſtole it. Theſe are fraudulent and deceitful Oaths.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Contrary to ſwearing in truth, is falſe ſwearing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie, when a man takes an Oath, and yet knows that that which he ſwears is falſe. And this hath been alwayes accounted both before God and man, a moſt horrible, odious and damnable ſin. Lying of it ſelf is a heinous ſinne, and therefore called <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.22. <hi>an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord:</hi> becauſe that God who is the God of truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hate and abhorre falſhood. But now when a man binds a lye with an Oath, he ſinnes not onely himſelf by lying; but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to entangle God in his ſinne by calling God to witneſſe that which he knows to be falſe. Hence it is that even the heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have alwayes been religious in obſerving their Oaths.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that leading his Army againſt a City with a ful reſolution to have utterly deſtroyed it, he ſaw <hi>Anaxime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Philoſopher, who had been his Tutor coming towards him, &amp; thinking that <hi>Anaximenes</hi> would be very urgent with him to ſpare the City, he ſwore in a fury, that whatſoever it was that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naximenes</hi> deſired, he would not grant it. <hi>Anaximenes</hi> deſired that he would deſtroy the City. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſeeing that he could not deſtroy it, but he muſt break his Oath, returned with his Army, and to ſave his Oath withall ſaved the City.</p>
            <p>And we read of <hi>Regulus</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Hanniball</hi> had taken priſoners, that having taken an Oath that they would go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and if ſome of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> vvere not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for them, they themſelves vvould return, vvhen they came to <hi>Rome</hi> and effected not that for vvhich they were ſent; yet they vvere ſo religious in obſerving their oaths, that though they knew for certaine that the ſaving of their oaths vvould be the loſſe of lives, yet they returned againe. So heinous a ſinne vvas perjury their accounted, even among the Heathen.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that this ſinne hath alwayes been ſo grievouſly puniſht, ſometime vvith baniſhment as among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vvith death as among the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> for they inflicted no
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:118276:105"/>leſſe then death upon every perjured perſon, as upon one who was guilty of two horrible crimes, impiety to the gods and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to men. Nay in this one there is a three-fold ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, againſt God by an infinite wrong to his holy Name. If the King ſhould commit the broad ſeale unto any Subject, to ſeale ſome matter which were for the honour of the King, and the good of the whole Kingdom, and the Subject ſhould ſeale ſome other matter with it, which the King utterly deteſted, as being a diſhonour to himſelfe, a diſadvantage to his ſubjects, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to his enemies: in ſo doing he ſhould be guilty of high Treaſon. And thus is he guilty of high Treaſon againſt God, that abuſeth his Name to the ratifying of falſhood. For God hath committed his ſacred Name as a ſeale unto us,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.6.</note> for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth, and the ending of ſtrife; both which, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of truth, and the cutting off of contention, make much for the glory of God, and the good of all men. Now he that ſwears falſly, abuſeth Gods Name to the confirming of a lie, which is moſt diſhonourable to God, who is <hi>the God of truth,</hi> moſt acceptable to the devill, who is <hi>the father of lying,</hi> and moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to men, among whom there cannot poſſibly be any ſociety, if there be no truth nor fidelity among them. If a man having a Tower or Caſtle committed to his keeping, ſhould betray it to the enemy, he ſhould be counted a Traitour to his Prince and Countrey. <hi>Gods Name</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is a ſtrong tower, whereunto the righteous reſort.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.10.</note> Now when a man ſwears falſly, he betraies this Tower unto the devill, who is Gods enemy; which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wrong to Gods ſacred Name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he that ſwears falſly is moſt injurious to men; for by this means many times it comes to paſſe, that the Jurors give up a falſe verdict, the Judge pronounceth an unjuſt ſentence, and the party that is innocent is deprived of his right.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, againſt himſelfe: for by calling God as a witneſſe to that which is falſe, while he ſeeks to eſcape the cenſure of men, he falls moſt fearfully into Gods hands, and to avoid a pecuniary mulct, or a bodily puniſhment, doth bind his ſoule over unto Gods judgements, who hath threatned before-hand, <hi>that he will not hold him guiltleſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being ſo hainous and horrible a ſinne, both before God and man, what may we think of thoſe who hold it lawfull to ſwear and for-ſwear, and both practiſe it in action, and defend
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:118276:105"/>it in writing? Thus the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts and Jeſuits, being brought before the Magiſtrate, and put to their oaths, they hold it lawfull to ſwear and for-ſwear themſelves. For this is the doctrine which is maintained among them, that unto dangerous interrogatories a man is not bound to anſwer, according to the meaning of the Magiſtrates demand, but that he may lawfully equivocate, and frame a ſafe meaning unto himſelfe, and ſwear unto it. As if a Prieſt being examined before the Magiſtrate, whether he be a Prieſt or no; though indeed he be, yet he may mean that he is not one of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, and ſo he may equivocate and ſwear that he is not. Thus <hi>Garnet</hi> Superiour of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> being examined before the Councell, &amp; put to his oath, whether he had not had any conference with <hi>Hall</hi> the Prieſt while he was in priſon, he took it upon his oath that he had had no conference with him, and when it was proved to his face to be falſe, and that he was for-ſworne; he anſwered onely this, that he had offended, if equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation did not help him. Thus <hi>Treſham</hi> the Traitour, while he lay in the Tower upon his death-bed, and died preſently after, he took it upon his ſalvation that he had not ſeen <hi>Garnet</hi> of ſixteen years before, which being afterwards found to be falſe, and that by <hi>Garnets</hi> own confeſſion, <hi>Garnet</hi> being askt what he thought of <hi>Treſham,</hi> he anſwer'd, he thought that he did equivocate. And thus under the pretence of equivocation, they hold it lawfull to ſwear and for-ſwear any thing. But this is moſt certain, that when we take an oath, and ſwear otherwiſe then that which we know to be the truth, whatſoever we pretend we are reputed as perjured in the ſight of God. <hi>Quacunque arte verborum quis utitur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſidor. de ſummo bonè lib. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Deus tamen</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſidore) qui conſcientia teſtis eſt it a hoc accipit, ſicut ille cui juratur intelligit.</hi> What cunning ſoever we uſe in ſwearing, yet God that ſees the conſcience, takes it in the ſame manner, as he underſtands it to whom he ſweared. And thus much for the firſt condition of an oath, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in truth.</hi> I come to the ſecond, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are two kindes of oaths, which are contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, inconſiderate and unadviſed oaths, as when we take an oath of that we do not underſtand, or when we ſwear to perform that which is not in our power. Such an oath is that which the King of <hi>India</hi> alwayes takes at his coronation, namely, <hi>That he will make the Sun to keep his courſe, and to give them light, that he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118276:106"/>will make the clouds to ſend them ſeaſonable ſhowers, that he will make their rivers that they ſhall never be dry, but run continually, and that he will make the earth that it ſhall not be barren, but bring forth fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi> Now theſe things are not in the power of man to performe. And ſuch an oath is that which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> take, when they vow virginity and a ſingle life, as if the gift of continency were in their own power and ability. Theſe are raſh and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed oaths. The <hi>Romans</hi> had a cuſtome, that he that ſhould ſwear by <hi>Hercules</hi> ſhould firſt go out of doores, that he might think of the oath which he was to take, and deliberate upon the matter which he was to ſwear. If they were ſo carefull that they ſwore not unadviſedly by the name of <hi>Hercules,</hi> how carefull ſhould we be that we uſe not Gods Name, but with great adviſe. And therefore before that we take an oath, we muſt pauſe upon it, and conſider what it is that we are to ſwear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, contrary to ſwearing in judgement, is idle, frivolous, and unneceſſary ſwearing, when we ſwear without cauſe, or upon any light occaſion. Thus ſome, though it be but a trifle whereof they are ſpeaking, yet if they be not believed in every word which they ſpeak, they will preſently rap out an oath to confirme it; and ſo God muſt be diſhonoured that they may be believed: yet their ſwearing is ſo far from ſaving their credit, and making them be believed, that it gives men occaſion the more to ſuſpect them. For who will believe that he makes conſcience of ſwearing truely, that makes no conſcience of ſwearing unneceſſarily? or that he will be carefull that he deceives not his neighbour, that makes no reckoning of diſpleaſing his Maker? For he that will not ſtick to diſhonour God upon no occaſion, it may not be ſuſpected that he will for-ſwear himſelfe, when by his oath he may gain any thing. But if the matter be not weighty, and of ſome importance, ſuch ſwearing is the prophaning of Gods Name: for thus the Name of God is brought into contempt, while it is uſed in matters of no weight and moment.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.26.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we ſee in the 18th. of <hi>Exodus, being Judge over Iſracl, he ſubſtituted inferiour officers under him, and appointed the Weightier matters to be brought to himſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all petty controverſies to be decided by them.</hi> If it were not ſit for <hi>Moſes</hi> to be called to the determining of inferiour cauſes, is it fit for us to call God as a witneſſe to triſling matters? If a man have a jewell, he will not lay it to pawn for every trifle, and if he do, it is an argument that he makes little reckoning of it.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118276:106"/>And ſurely he makes but ſmall account of Gods ſacred Name, that is ready to pawn it upon every light occaſion: yet this is a ſinne then the which there is nothing more ordinary and common. Some there are that take a pride in ſwearing, and will ſcarce ſpeak a word but an oath muſt ſecond it, as if ſwearing were not ſo much a ſinne, as a grace to their ſpeech, and a matter of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And theſe are counted the great Gallants of the World. Others that are given to unneceſſary ſwearing, if a man chance to reprove them for it, they will ſay for themſelves, that they do not ſwear of any ill intent, for they ſwear many times when they do not mind it, and therefore they hope that it is no ſinne, becauſe they mean no harme. But if that their tongues ſhould ſpeak treaſon, would it help them to ſay, that they did not minde it? would not their hearts be thought to conſpire with their tongues, and ſhould not their heads (think ye) pay for it? Can they bridle their tongues, and minde what they ſay, for fear of ſpeaking treaſon againſt an earthly King, and can they not beware that they do not blaſpheme the King of Heaven? but the truth is, that they ſee in the one a preſent danger, and not in the other. For ſhould they ſpeak treaſon, they know that every man would be ready to accuſe them, and that they ſhould preſently ſuffer for it; but as for the diſhonouring of Gods Name, becauſe it is not cenſured among men, they do not regard it; others that are given to unneceſſary ſwearing, will ſay, they have got ſuch a cuſtome of ſwearing, that they cannot leave it; as if their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſwearing did rather leſſen then increaſe their ſinne. <hi>Plato</hi> reprehending one for playing at dice, and he replying, do you reprehend me Sir for ſo ſmall a matter? The matter indeed, quoth <hi>Plato,</hi> is ſmall, but the cuſtome of it is no ſmall matter. And ſurely, if ſwearing of it ſelfe were but an ordinary ſinne, yet it is made far the greater by ordinary ſwearing. If a thieſe being brought before a Judge for ſome robbery he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould acknowledge the fact, and yet deſire to be excuſed, becauſe all his life-time he had been ſo accuſtomed to robbing, that he could not well leave it, would this excuſe, think ye, ſerve his turne? And when he that hath daily robbed God of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by prophaning his Nune upon every light occaſion, ſhall be called to an account at the day of judgement, and ſhall plead for himſelfe, that he had ſo inured his tongue to ſwearing ever ſince he was a childe, that he could never afterwards leave it, will God
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:118276:107"/>take this for a ſufficient excuſe? Surely, if a man ſhall anſwer for every idle word that he ſpeaks, much more ſhall he anſwer for idle oaths. And indeed there is great reaſon, that God ſhould be a ſevere judge againſt thoſe that ſwear unneceſſarily, and upon no occaſion.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Though this be reputed in the world but a ſmall ſinne, yet there is not almoſt any ſinne which a man commits, wherein he ſhewes ſo inſolent contempt of Gods ſacred Name, as he ſhews in this. For other ſinnes which a man commits, yet he may pretend ſome ſhew of excuſe. He that doth not ſanctifie the Sabbath day, will pretend it may be ſome extraordinary buſineſſe; he that ſteals from his neighbour, will pretend that he did it for neceſſity and want; he that kills a man, will pretend that he did it for the wrong which he offered him, and to ſave his credit &amp; reputation; he that makes a lye that he did it for fear: and ſo for any ſin a man may pretend ſomething; but for ordinary ſwearing no excuſe can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a man cannot pretend that he doth it for fear, or for his gaine and profit, or for any thing whatſoever. And therefore there is great reaſon, as I ſaid before, that God ſhould ſeverely puniſh them, that ſwear idly and vainly, and upon no occaſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe there is not any one ſinne, that ſo ordinarily goes ſcot-free among men, as this ordinary ſwearing and profaning of Gods Name.</p>
            <p>If a man do but ſlander and defame his neighbour, the Law takes hold of him and he ſhall under go the penalty; but for the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſhonouring of Gods Name, it is not cenſured among men. We have Bedlams provided for frantick perſons, we have Peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes provided for ſuch as are infected, and we have Goales and priſons for theeves and robbers, but for ſuch as are a thouſand times more mad &amp; infectious, for ſuch as daly rob God of his glory, by profaning his Name without any occaſion, there is no place of reſtraint nor puniſhment appointed. And therefore God who is jealous of his honour, hath taken the cauſe into his own hands, and threatens, that howſoever they that abuſe his name do eſcape before men; yet he himſelfe <hi>will not hold them guiltleſſe.</hi> And thus much for the ſecond condition of an oath, <hi>that we muſt ſwear in judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the laſt condition, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> I will ſpeak but a word or two of it.</p>
            <p>This condition requires, that the matter whereof we take an
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:118276:107"/>oath be juſt and lawfull; And hereunto are contrary all wicked oaths, vvhich are taken for the performance of any unlawfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such an oath was that vvhich vvas taken by <hi>Herod, Marke</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 6.26 <hi>Acts</hi> 23.21.</note> when for the ſaving of his oath <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was beheaded. Such an oath was that which vvas taken by the <hi>Iews Acts</hi> 23. that <hi>they would neither eate nor drink ſtill they had killed Saint Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch are thoſe oaths, which have been taken by the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> for the murdering of Princes, and for the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their conſpiracy and treaſon. Thus vvhen they vvent about the moſt horrible treaſon that ever vvas, their Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot, the memory vvhereof vvil continue for ever to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſhame; they ſwore by the bleſſed, Trinity, and by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vvhich they vvere then to take, that they vvould never diſcloſe it. A moſt horrible ſinne, while they could not be content to be Traytors themſelves, but God muſt be made an actor in their treaſons, &amp; his name muſt help to ſettle them forward therein. <hi>Non ad hoc inſtitutum eſt juramentum ut ſit ini juitatis vinculum:</hi> an oath was not ordain'd to this end that it ſhould be the bond of iniquity, much leſſe of Treaſon. Such oaths are better broke then kept. And therefore <hi>David</hi> (vvith vvhich I vvill conclude) when he had ſworn in a paſſion to kill <hi>Nabal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32.</note> yet afterward he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him upon <hi>Abigails</hi> interceſſion, and bleſſed God for ſending <hi>Abigail</hi> to intreate for him. <hi>Juravit David temeré</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>

            <p>Concerning the firſt, Gods gracious renewing of <hi>Jonas</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, God had given <hi>Jonas</hi> this Commiſſion before, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the very ſame words (in the firſt Chapter, the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſes) yet becauſe <hi>Jonas</hi> had made his firſt Commiſſion void by his diſobedience unto God, it was requiſite, that if God would ſtill have him to go to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> he ſhould renue his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and give him a ſecond Charge, about the ſame buſineſſe, and that eſpecially in two reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to remove ſome ſcruples out of <hi>Jonas</hi> his minde, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might have made <hi>Jonas</hi> to think that God would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him any more in it. For <hi>Jonas</hi> did not know what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen <hi>Nineveh,</hi> whether <hi>Nineveh</hi> yet ſtood, or was overthrown ſince the time that God had given him his firſt Commiſſion, and had appointed him to proclaime their deſtruction: he could not tell, whether God had ſent any other thither in his roome, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the charge which himſelf ſhould have done, and he could not but think, that he had made himſelf unworthy of ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, who had carried himſelf ſo rebelliouſly in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was requiſite, that if God would ſtill have him to go to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> he ſhould renew his Commiſſion, as here he did. So when <hi>Peter</hi> had denied his Maſter, and had made himſelf unworthy of his <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> by ſo foule a denial, leaſt <hi>Peter</hi> might ſuppoſe, that thereby he had deprived himſelf of his place, and was no longer one of Chriſt Apoſtles, Chriſt was the more careful to reſtore him to his Office. And therefore as ſoones as Chriſt was riſen, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.7. had the women that came to the epulcher, to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118276:109"/>tell the Diſciples and <hi>Peter,</hi> that Chriſt was riſen.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.7.</note> But why is <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> named more then any of the reſt? was not he comprehended among the Diſciples? But if the women had ſaid, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell willed them to bring the Diſciples this Meſſage, <hi>Peter</hi> might have thought that he was not one of them, as having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy to be Chriſt Diſciple, becauſe he had denied him. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> is more ſpecially named, to aſſure him the better that Chriſt had both pardoned the ſinne of his denial, and ſtill counted him to be one of his Diſciples as he was before. And ſo leaſt <hi>Jonas</hi> might think that he had made himſelf unworthy of his propheticall Office, that had carried himſelf ſo rebelliouſly in it, God therefore here renews his Commiſſion, and imployes him again in the ſame work whereunto he had before deſigned him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God renews his Commiſſion, and gives him a new charge to go to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe if <hi>Jonas</hi> had gone thither, upon his firſt Commiſſion which he had made void, he had gone without his warrant from God, which had been dangerous for him. This we may ſee by the like example of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the 14. of <hi>Numbers.</hi> God had promiſed to give them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo they were to fight with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and God would aſſiſt them. The ſpies that were ſent thither did bring up an evill report of the Land, that the Inhabitants dwelt in high walled Cities, that they were men of great ſtature and very ſtrong, and that they ſaw the Sonnes of <hi>Anak,</hi> who were Giants among them: which when the people heard, they preſently fell to their old veine of murmuring, and diſtruſting Gods promiſe of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> they would have choſen them a Captain to lead them back into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Hereupon God ſent a plague among them, then they would needes go and fight with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but then <hi>Moſes</hi> forbad them, go not up, faith he, for the Lord is not among you, becauſe ye are turned away from the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord wil not be with you. But they notwithſtanding went &amp; fought with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and were diſcomſited by them. For they had made themſelves unworthy of Gods help and aſſiſtance, by diſtruſting his promiſe, and ſo had not Gods warrant for their fighting with them. And thus here it had been dangerous for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> to have gone to <hi>Nineveh</hi> upon his firſt Commiſſion, which he had now made void by his diſobedience unto God, but that God ſent him thither with a ſecond Warrant. Here then obſerve Gods wonderfull goodneſſe and mercy to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> in not onely pardoning his former Rebellion, but reſtoring
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118276:110"/>him to his propheticall Office and dignity from whence he was fallen. God deales more graciouſly with his Servants, then earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes do vvith their Subjects. If a ſubject that is in any high Office, do rebel againſt his Prince, though the Prince be ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to pardon his Rebellion, yet he vvill not ſuffer him to hold his Office, but vvill deprive him of it, even in point of policy, that he may be the leſſe able, being in lower place, to rebel hereafter, and that the loſſe of his Office may remaine as a ſcarre and blemiſh unto him for his former Rebellion. But God here deales more graciouſly vvith <hi>Jonas,</hi> vvho had carried himſelf ſo rebelliouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, both pardoning his ſinne and reſtoring him to his place, that not ſo much as the leaſt ſcarre of his former Rebellion, might remain to be ſeen, which ſhewes by the vvay, that the hereſie of the <hi>Novatians</hi> was very groſſe, in holding that all ſuch as after Baptiſme fell into ſinne, vvere cut off from the Church, and could not attain unto ſalvation, howſoever they carried themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and ſought it vvith teares. But vvas not Circumciſion the ſame to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> vvhich Baptiſme is to <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> and did not <hi>Johnas,</hi> after he vvas circumciſed, rebell againſt <hi>God,</hi> and yet vvas pardoned and reſtored by <hi>God</hi> to his propheticall Office? Did not <hi>David</hi> after he vvas circumciſed, commit adultery and murther, and yet did not the Lord put away his ſinne upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Did not <hi>Peter,</hi> after he was baptized, denie our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and yet was reſtored unto his <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> and afterwards proved a glorious Martyr? Therefore vvhen <hi>Aceſius</hi> a Biſhop of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> at the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſhewed <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the ſtrictneſſe of their opinions, how a man after Baptiſme, if he will be ſaved, muſt live vvithout ſinne, the good Emperour anſwer'd him, if this be ſo <hi>Aceſius,</hi> then ſet up a ladder for thy ſelf, and climbe alone into Heaven. For vvho could be ſaved, if none vvere admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Heaven that ſinne after Baptiſme? But vve know that Gods promiſe to ſinners is generall, that at vvhat time ſoever a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repents, God vvill put all his vvickedneſſe out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Chriſts invitation of ſinners is generall,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Come unto me all ye that are Weary and heavy loaden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> And Chriſt teacheth us daily to pray unto <hi>God</hi> for the pardon of our ſinnes, to ſhew that as vve daily ſinne, ſo vve are daily to pray for pardon, vvhich ye know vvere in vaine, if no man vvere pardoned that ſins after Baptiſme.

It cannot be while we live in this world but that offence will be given us, and that we ſhall have juſt cauſe to be offended with others; yet that we may not be ſo offended as to ſeek to be revenged, the Scriputre ſtill mentions Gods pardoning of them that offend him, to provoke us thereby to forgive others: God ſpeaking as it were by his example unto us, and ſaying as <hi>Gideon</hi> did to his followers,<note place="margin">

This the Apoſtle requires of us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 <hi>Forgive one another,</hi>

                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.32.</note> 
               <hi>as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> This Chriſt requires of us, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. both with a promiſe, that if we forgive others, God will forgive us; and under a penalty, that God will not forgive us if we forgive not others: and binding us no otherwiſe to ask God forgiveneſſe, then upon this condition that we forgive others, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenſoever therefore thou art offended with any, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be revenged on him that wrongs thee, conſider the great danger if thou do it, conſider the great benefit if thou do it not, and ſet GOD as a patterne before thine eyes, and remember how he pardons our offences. For what canſt thou or any one pretend, why God ſhould be willing to forgive thee, if thou be unwilling to forgive him that offends thee?</p>
            <p>If thou ſayeſt, that he that hath offended thee, is one that hath many times done thee vvrong, that thou haſt forborne him a long time and forgiven him often; and therefore canſt not indure to forbear him any longer, ſeeing he ſtill provokes thee to be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him. I would ask thee again, and haſt not thou more often offended God, then any can poſſibly offend thee? Hath not God forborne thee ever ſince thou wert borne, and doſt thou not ſtill every day offend him? Well therefore may'ſt thou forgive him that offends thee, if God have ſo often forgiven thee; Forgive him that offends thee an hundred pence, when God hath forgiven thee ten thouſand talents.</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:118276:111"/>
            <p>If thou ſayeſt againe, But I have been alwayes a friend unto him that hath done me wrong, I have ſhewed him much kindneſſe, and never deſerved but well of him; and therefore ſeeing he requites me evill for good, how can I forgive him? I would ask thee again, But hath not God deſerved alwayes far better of thee, then thou of him that offends thee? Is it not God that gives thee life and health, and all things beſides? Is it not he that gives thee rain from Heaven and fruitfull ſeaſons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17.</note> filling thy heart, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, with food and gladneſſe? Is it not he that continually preſerves both thee and thine from a thouſand dangers? And yet thou not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding doſt daily requite him evil for good, by ſinning againſt him: and therefore if he do thus forgive thee, then why ſhouldſt not thou forgive him that offends thee?</p>
            <p>If thou ſais;t again, But if I ſtill pardon and forbear him that wrongs me, I cannot but reap diſcredit thereby, becauſe every man will think the more hardly of me. I would ask thee again, But did ever any man reape diſcredit by doing that which God commands him? And if thou ſhouldſt reape diſcredit thereby; yet were it not better that thou ſhouldſt be diſcredited, then that God ſhould be diſobeyed? Were it not better that men ſhould think bardly of thee then that God ſhould condemn thee? men thingk hardly of thee for ſuffring wrong, then that God ſhould condemn thee for revenging the ſame? And therefore howſoever thou art wrong'd or oftended, regard not what others will think of thee; but what God commands thee; and let his example move thee to forgive others, who here forgave <hi>Ionas,</hi> that had ſo highly offended him, and reſtored him to his Propheticall office.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Seeing God dealt ſo gratiouſly with <hi>Jonas,</hi> that had ſo grievouſly offended him; Let it therefore teach us, <hi>how heinunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever we have offended God, not to deſpaire of pardon.</hi> For <hi>Gods</hi> merty to others may well be a comfort and incouragement to us. Ye know it was an incouragement to King <hi>Benhadad</hi> and the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to ſubmit themſelves to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.</note> and to hope he would pardon them: becauſe they had heard, that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were mercifull Kings.

Therefore to ſhew that he is gracious
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:118276:111"/>and mercifull, he commonly bears a long time vvith ſinners, he doth not puniſh them ſo ſoon as they offend him, but doth long forbear them, <hi>that his forbearance and long-ſuffering might lead them to repentance.</hi> He cries to ſuch as go on in their ſinnes,<note place="margin">

               <hi>yet they had provoked him ten times. Nay he was able to charge them, that forty years long he had been grieved with that generation.</hi> So gracious is God in forbearing them long that do offend him. And as he is long-ſuffering, ſo he is ſlow in puniſhing, not inflicting his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments altogether, and at once, but by little and little, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. <hi>That the Angels powred out the vials of Gods wrath upon the earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.1.</note> Now ye know a viall hath a narrow mouth, that which is poured out of it, comes but <hi>guttatim,</hi> drop by drop, and is long coming out. So it is when god puniſhes, his puniſhments come ſlowly, that even while he is puniſhing, men might be drawn to repentance. And if they repent, how many ſoever their ſinnes have been, hovv hainous ſoever, and hovv long ſoever they have continued therein, he is ready to forgive them. You will ſay, indeed if I could repent of my ſins, I doubt not but God who is ſo infinitely mercifull would receive me into favour, and be reconciled unto me in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> but I have ſo hard a heart, that ſtill I go on, and continue in ſinne, and cannot repent. I would therefore aske thee, But art thou not diſpleaſed with the hardneſſe of thy heart? and doeſt thou not deſire to forſake thy ſins, and to be reconciled unto God? Oh this, you vvill ſay, is that which I deſire above all things in the World.

And here though the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetes</hi> vvere ſo hainous ſinners, yet he ſends unto them, that being fore-warned of the danger they were in, they might repent, and avoid the ſame.</p>

Yet <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> was not ſo large as <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but leſſe in compaſſe by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an hundred furlongs. <hi>Nineveh</hi> was many years in building, and by no fewer at once, then ten thouſand work-men, and it was ſo populous, that God tells <hi>Jonas</hi> in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> the laſt <hi>verſe, That there were ſix-ſcore thouſand in it that knew not their right hand from their left:</hi> and therefore if there were ſo many infants, what a multitude were there of all other ages, no doubt but many more in that one City, then there are now in ſome King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.

Before, he thought it a very hard Commandement, that he ſhould leave his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to go to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> leave the place vvhere he had been bred and borne to preach among ſtrangers, leave the people of God to preach among Infidels. He thought it vvould be very dangerous for him, to carry ſo unwelcome a Meſſage to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> that <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould be overthrown after forty dayes. He remembred beſides, that God was ſo gracious, that though God had ſent him to proclaim their deſtruction, yet if the <hi>Ninevites</hi> ſhould repent, he would ſpare the City, and ſo he ſhould be counted a falſe Prophet among them. And many other ſcruples no doubt came in his mind, for which he thought it a very hard Commandement; but now he ſtands not upon any difficulty, but goes readily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. His example then may teach us this leſſon, that when Gods will is made known unto us, we muſt readily yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto, and do that which God Commands, though it ſeeme never ſo difficult, never ſo dangerous. It might have ſeem'd unto <hi>Noe</hi> a very hard Commandement, when God Commanded him to make the Ark, and there were many difficulties which might have taken away the edge of his obedience, and diſcouraged him from taking ſuch a work in hand. He might have been diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the tediouſneſſe of the work, that ſeeing God would have him make it ſo large and ſo great, it would hold him a long time before he could finiſh it.</p>
            <p>He might have been diſcouraged by the great coſt and charges which he was to be at in making the Arke. For beſides his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary paines and labour, it muſt needes be an exceſſive charge unto him. The ſending up and down to provide ſuch a World of ſtuffe and timber, the felling, ſawing, and ſquaring of it, the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the place where the Arke was to be made, the vvorkmens daily vvages for ſo many years, and the great ſtore of food which vvas to be provided and laid up in the Arke for the preſervation and ſuſterance of all the living Creatures vvhich vvere to abide in the Arke for a twelve-moneth and upwards, muſt needes be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of exceſſive charges. He might have been diſcouraged by the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118276:114"/>continual taunts of the vvicked, vvho vvould ſcoffe and deride him for making the Arke, and make him a common by-word among them, vvhile he vvas about it. But <hi>Noe</hi> having reſpect unto Gods Commandement, his diſobedience brake through all theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he took the vvork in hand, and accordingly finiſht it: ſo it might have ſeem'd unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a very hard Commandement, vvhen God commanded him to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and there vvere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties vvhich might have diſcouraged him from the doing of it, and hindred his obedience. He might have alleadged that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was his onely Sonne, and that he had no other to be his Heire, to inherit the goods vvhich <hi>God</hi> had given him: that <hi>God</hi> had given him <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be a comfort unto him in his old age, and had promiſed that all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in him: that he and <hi>Sarah</hi> his vvife vvere old, and ſo not like to have any more Children. He might have pretended, that it was a moſt barbarous and unnaturall Act, for a Father to kill his own Sonne, that it would make him odious among his Neighbours, and be a foule diſgrace and reproach unto him, vvhereſoever he came. and many pretences he might have alledged vvhy he ſhould not do it; but having <hi>Gods</hi> Commandement, he ſtood not upon any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty therein, but vvent readily about it. For vvhatſoever it is that <hi>God</hi> Commands us, though it ſeeme never ſo hard unto fleſh and bloud, yet we are bound to yield him obedience, becauſe he hath abſolute power and Command over us. The Command of a Father over his Sonne is very great, and vvhat will not a Sonne do that lieth in his power vvhen his Father Commands him? <hi>Nihil quod pater jubet grave niſi ſitimpoſſibile,</hi> Nothing is grievous that a Father Commands, unleſſe he Commands an impoſſibility. We ſee how the <hi>Rechabits, Jer.</hi> 35. were commanded by <hi>Jonadab</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that neither they themſelves, nor their Sonnes, nor their Daughters, nor their Children and Poſterity for ever after them, ſhould ever drink any wine, or build any houſes, or ſow any ſeed, or plant any Vineyards, or have any, but that all their dayes they ſhould dwell in Tents. Though their Father hereby did abridge them of many commodities and comforts of this life, vvhich are both lawful and neceſſary, yet becauſe it was the Command of their Father, they abſtained from every thing that he forbad them, and obeyed his vvill. And vve ſee that <hi>Iſaac,</hi> vvhen his Father was to offer him for a burnt-offring, though <hi>Iſaac</hi> was then about twenty five years old, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> vvrites, yet he reſiſted not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118276:114"/>but ſuffered him to binde him, and to lay him upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſubmitting himſelf to the very death to his Fathers vvill. So the Command of Princes over their Subjects is very great, and what vvill not a Subject be content to do for his Princes ſake?<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16.</note> ye know vvhen <hi>David</hi> did long to drink of the vvater of the vvell of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi> three of his Servants did break through the Hoſt of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins,</hi> and brought him ſome of it even with the hazard of their lives. So when <hi>Xerxes</hi> was upon the Sea in a dangerous tempeſt, and the Governour of the ſhip told him, that there was no hope to eſcape, unleſſe the ſhip vvere lightned: divers of his Nobility caſt themſelves into the Sea, that the King might eſcape. And we read of a Prince of <hi>Syria,</hi> that his Subjects vvere ſo ready to do vvhat he Commanded, that vvhen he called to a Centinel that vvas on the top of an high vvatch-towre, and bad him come down vvith all ſpeed to him, he preſently leapt over the Battlements, and ſtood not upon the loſſe of his life to ſhew his obedience. If Children be ſo much at the Command of their Fathers, and Subjects of their Princes, then vvhat ſhould not vve do for our heavenly Father the King of Kings vvhen he Command us? For he hath abſolute power over us, our goods and our lives, our bodies and our ſoules, and all that we have, are at his diſpoſing, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he Command us, though it ſeeme never ſo difficult or dangerous, yet vve ought vvith <hi>Ionas</hi> here, to yield him obedience.</p>

            <p>And firſt for the property of an impenitent ſinner, <hi>that he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his ſins.</hi> For our better underſtanding thereof, I purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How ſinne may be ſaid to be covered.</item>
               <item>And 2. What is the cauſe that makes a man cover and hide his ſinnes.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, we are to know that the Scripture makes mention of a twofold covering or hiding of ſinne; the one by <hi>God,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by man. <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to cover our ſinnes when he doth forgive them, and doth not impute our ſinnes unto us; and he that hath
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118276:115"/>his ſinnes thus covered by God, is pronounced by <hi>David</hi> to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and bleſſed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe wickedneſſe is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whoſe ſinnes are covered;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.</note> bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne.</hi> He that hath his ſinnes thus covered by God, neede not care though they be known to all the World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a covering of ſinne by man, and this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe twofold, vvhen a man doth cover either the ſinnes of others, or his own ſinnes. The ſinnes of others two wayes eſpecially, by charity or by flattery. By charity, when vve conceal the faults of others, to keep them thereby from ſhame and diſgrace, as <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> covered their Fathers nakedneſſe; for charity will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, a multitude of ſinnes. Or elſe by flattery, for the flatterer who is but a fawning friend,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.</note> knowing that men love to be commended, and not to be diſpraiſed, he frames himſelf to ſpeak nothing but that which is pleaſing, and therefore will highly commend men for their virtues, or any good parts that he ſees to be in them; but for their faults or vices, he will be ſure not to ſpeak a word thereof, but he will hide and cover them. But <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſpeaks not of covering other mens ſinnes, but of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of our own, when a man doth what he can to conceal his own ſinnes, and to keep them hidden, as <hi>Achan</hi> hidde and covered his theft that it might not be known.<note place="margin">Ioſh. <hi>7.21.</hi>
               </note> And thus a man may be faid to cover his ſinnes four wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by a plain and flat denial of them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Negando.</note> Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> when ſhe heard, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. that ſhe ſhould conceive,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.15.</note> and bring forth a Child in her old age, ſhe laught at it,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.25.</note> and being reproved by the Angel for laughing, ſhe preſently denied it. Thus <hi>Gebezi,</hi> being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Prophet for taking a bribe, he would have covered his ſinne by denial of it. And thus many when they are ſuſpected or accuſed of any thing which indeed they have done, but think it cannot eaſily be proved againſt them, they will never confeſſe it, but ſeek by their deniall to keep it ſecret. They will never be brought to confeſſe they have ſinned, till they be taken in their ſinne, ſo that the firſt time of their taking, ſhall be the firſt time of their ſinning; for they will be ſure to confeſſe no more then can be proved againſt them. This is one kind of covering of ſinne. And hitherto may they be referred, who hold with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that they do perfectly fulfill Gods Law, and that they are free from
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118276:116"/>ſinne:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.</note> or that ſay with the proud Phariſee, <hi>I am not an extertioner, I am not unjuſt, I am not an adulterer like other men:</hi> or with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. <hi>3.17.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I am rich, I am increaſed with goods, and I have need of nothing;</hi> for theſe do hide and cover their ſinnes by their deniall of them.</p>
            <p>In ſtead hereof, we muſt lay our ſinnes open, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſe them. For he that doth deny his fault, he is not therefore without fault, becauſe he denieth it, but he both doubleth his fault by his deniall thereof, and is the further from obtaining pardon for want of acknowledging it: as he that hath received a wound in his body, both makes it the worſe, and is the further from being cured while he ſeeks to conceale it.</p>
            <p>And therefore whenſoever thou haſt done any thing which thou ſhouldſt not have done, though thou be aſhamed to have it known, yet being charged therewith, beware of denying it, but think thus with thy ſelfe, It is too much that I have done already, let me not therefore double my fault by my deniall of it, but what I was not aſhamed to do, yet let me not be aſhamed to confeſſe, that God may pardon it.</p>
            <p>So did <hi>David</hi> being reproved by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> he did not deny, but acknowledge his ſinne, and obtain'd pardon,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13.</note> 
               <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and the Lord hath put away thy ſinne,</hi> ſaith the Prophet; which queſtion-leſſe had not thus been put away, if <hi>David</hi> had ſought to have covered his ſin by his deniall of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, A man may be ſaid to cover his ſinnes, by tranſlating the fault,<note place="margin">Transferendo</note> and ſhifting it off from himſelfe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And this is a ſinne as old as <hi>Adam,</hi> and committed firſt by him. For <hi>Adam</hi> ye know being reproved by God for eating of the forbidden fruit, to excuſe himſelf, he laid the blame upon <hi>Eve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12.</note> 
               <hi>The Woman that thou gaveſt me, ſhe gave me of the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Woman that the blame might not reſt upon her,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.13.</note> did lay it on the Serpent. <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſhifting off the blame from our ſelves to others, we have learned of them.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:118276:116"/>
            <p>If <hi>Saul</hi> be reproved by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> for tranſgreſſing the Commandment of the Lord, in ſparing the king of <hi>Amalek,</hi> and the beſt of the cattell; he will poſt it from himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.20, 21.</note> and lay the blame on the people: <hi>I obeyed the voice of the Lord, but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the people took of the ſpoil,</hi> And if <hi>Aaron</hi> be reproved by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for his ſin in making the golden calf, he will lay the fault on the people for it: <hi>Thou knoweſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this people, that they are ſet on miſchief. And they ſaid unto me, Make us gods.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32.22.</note> And thus many when the fault which they have committed, is ſo plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they cannot well deny it, yet to excuſe themſelves, they will lay the blame upon others. This is a ſecond kinde of covering of ſin. And hitherto may they be referred, who to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, aſcribe their ſins unto fate or deſtinie, as the <hi>Priſcilianiſts</hi> did; or that make God to be the Author of their ſins as the <hi>Libertines</hi> did, for theſe do hide and cover their ſins by laying them on others. Inſtead hereof, what ſin ſoever we have committed, we muſt take the blame wholly upon our ſelves, and not ſeek that others may bear the blame for what we have done. If we do any thing which we think is praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and deſerves commendation, we would be loath that others ſhould be ſharers therein, and would think our ſelves to be wrong'd by thoſe, who ſhould take to themſelves the praiſe of that which was done by us. And therefore when we have done amiſſe, great reaſon we ſhould take the blame to our ſelves, and not lay it on others. So did <hi>Jonah</hi> when he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, by flying to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and God therefore puniſhed him with a tempeſt on the Sea, that they were all in danger to be caſt away; he took the blame wholly upon himſelf though it would coſt him his life: <hi>Take me up,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Jon. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>and caſt me into the Sea, for I know that for my ſake this tempeſt is upon you.</hi> And ſo did <hi>David,</hi> when he had ſinned againſt God, by numbring the people, and God therefore ſent a peſtilence on the Land which ſwept away many thouſands; and <hi>David ſaw the Angel which ſmote the people,</hi> he took the blame wholly upon himſelf, and ſaid to the Lord, <hi>Lo, I have ſinned, I have done wickedly: but theſe ſheep, what have they done? let thy hand I pray thee be againſt me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17.</note> 
               <hi>and my fathers houſe.</hi> And thus muſt we do, whenſoever we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we muſt take the blame wholly to our ſelves, and not ſeek
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118276:117"/>to hide and cover our ſins, by ſhifting them off from our ſelves to others.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, a man may be ſaid to cover his ſins, by extenuating, diminiſhing,<note place="margin">Extennando.</note> and leſſning the ſin. Thus the harlot when ſhe inticed the young man to commit folly with her, ſhe leſſened the ſin whereunto ſhe inticed him,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.18.</note> 
               <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>let us take our fill of love, and delight our ſelves in daliance:</hi> giving it the name of love and daliance, which indeed was whoredome. And thus many will leſſen and extenuate their ſins, making their ſins to be leſſe then they are, and themſelves leſſe ſinfull, making great ſins to be but little,<note place="margin">Luk. 16 6.</note> and little ſins to be none at all. Ye know how the unjuſt ſteward did with the debts which were owing to his lord, he leſſened the ſumme, ſetting down but fifty for an hundred. So do many with their ſins their debts unto God, they leſſen and diminiſh the ſumme of them, making talents but pounds, and pounds but pence, and pence nothing. This is a third kinde of covering of ſin. And hitherto may they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, who leſſen and extenuate the heinouſneſſe of ſin, making ſome ſins, as the Papiſts do, to be but veniall, and that they do not deſerve eternall damnation. For theſe do hide and cover their ſins by their leſſening of them. Inſtead hereof we muſt aggravate our ſins, making our ſins, as indeed they are, out of meaſure ſinfull,<note place="margin">Ezra 98.</note> the more to humble us. So did <hi>Ezra, O my God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face to thee: for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are increaſed over our heads, and our treſpaſſe is grown up to the heavens.</hi> And ſo did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of Chriſt, though he did it of ignorance, yet he aggravates his ſin,<note place="margin">Act. 26.11.</note> that he perſecuted the Church of God above meaſure, that he waſted or made havock of it, that he puniſht them often in every Synagogue, that he compell'd them to blaſpheme, and that he was exceedingly mad againſt them. Thus in extreame deteſtation of his ſin, he ſtrives to make it extreamly heinous,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3 8.1 lim. 1.15.</note> and thought himſelf for his ſin not onely the leaſt of all Saints, but the greateſt of all ſinners. So far was he from covering his ſin by leſſening the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, a man may be ſaid to cover his ſins, by juſtifying, maintaining,<note place="margin">Juſtificando.</note> and defending of them. Thus <hi>Jonah</hi> being angry for the gourd that withered, when God asked him whether he
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:118276:117"/>did well to be angrie, he juſtified his fault, <hi>I do well,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Jon. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>to be angrie even to the death.</hi> And thus many when they have no other evaſion, when they can neither deny the fact, nor ſhift it off from themſelves, nor leſſen the ſame, yet they will juſtifie their faults, and ſtand in defence of that which they have done. So do they, who when they have committed a ſin, will pretend very ſpecious and plauſible reaſons why they did the ſame, that ſo it may ſeem to be no ſin in them. We read of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant, that coming into a Temple where there were Idols that were richly adorn'd, he took away from one of them a cloak of gold; and being askt why he did it, He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he did it to pleaſure the Idoll, becauſe the cloak was too heavie for Summer, and too cold for Winter: And afterwards taking Sea, and finding the winds to be favourable to him in his navigation, See, ſaith he, how the gods do approve of ſacriledge: but theſe were but pretences to cloak his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe. And hitherto may they be referr'd, who to juſtifie their faults, do alledge examples out of the Scripture of holy men, that have fallen into the ſame ſins; as <hi>Noahs</hi> example for their drunkenneſſe, <hi>Davids</hi> example for their adulterie, <hi>Peters</hi> for their perjurie, for theſe do hide and cover their ſins, by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the ſame by the examples of others. And this is the worſt kinde of covering of ſin. For is it not a fearfull thing to be imboldned to ſin by their examples, whoſe examples are ſet down to make us afraid to ſin? to follow their examples in ſomething which they did, which they repented that they ever did? and to mark how they ſinned, and not to mark how they were puniſht for it? For their puniſhment is regiſtred as well as their ſin, to keep us from falling into the like ſin, for fear of undergoing the like puniſhment. And yet theſe are not afraid to commit the like ſins, and will juſtifie the ſame by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Inſtead hereof, of covering our ſins by our juſtifying of them, we muſt arraign and condemne our ſins and our ſelves for them: otherwiſe if we juſtifie any of our ſins, thoſe ſins which we juſtifie, and do not condemne, will condemne us. And thus having ſhewed you, how men may be ſaid to cover their ſins, I will now proceed to the cauſes of it.<note place="margin">Cauſes why men cover their ſins.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The cauſes which make men thus to cover their ſins, either
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:118276:118"/>by denying them, or by laying the blame thereof upon others, or by leſſening their faults, or by juſtifying and ſtanding in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of them; the cauſes hereof are eſpecially three. Sometimes fear,<note place="margin">Fear.</note> ſometimes ſelf love, and ſometimes hypocriſie. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fear, of ſuffering either diſgrace or puniſhment, or incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſpleaſure if their ſins ſhould be known, and not be kept hidden.<note place="margin">Act. 5.2.</note> Thus <hi>Ananias</hi> when he had ſold his poſſeſſions, out of a covetous minde he kept back part of the price, yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd what he had done for fear of diſgrace.<note place="margin">Ioſh, 7.21.</note> Thus <hi>Achan</hi> hid his theft for fear of puniſhment. And thus <hi>Rachel</hi> hid the Idols which ſhe had ſtolne from her father,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.34.</note> for fear of incurring her fathers diſpleaſure, if they had been found with her. But is not this a prepoſterous kinde of fear, not to fear to ſin, but to fear what may follow when we have ſinned? To fear diſpleaſure, diſgrace, or puniſhment, and not to fear that which will bring us unto it? For this is all one, as if a man ſhould be afraid to be poyſoned, and yet not be afraid to drink poyſon. O but you will ſay, when I ſin I am in hope to keep my ſin unknown, and therefore am the leſſe fearfull to ſin, as hoping to eſcape diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or puniſhment while my ſin is kept hidden. But though thou mayeſt hide thy ſin from man, canſt thou hide it from God? canſt thou ſin ſo ſecretly that God ſhall not ſee thee? or canſt thou hide thy ſins from thine own conſcience, that is as good as a thouſand witneſſes againſt thee? <hi>Quid prodeſt non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere conſcium, babenti conſcientiam?</hi> What profits it thee, that no man is privie to that which thou doeſt, having a conſcience that is privie to it, and will condemne thee for it? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhouldſt be afraid to commit ſin, becauſe God and thy conſcience knows what thou doeſt, though it be unknown to men.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond cauſe of our covering of ſin is <hi>ſelf-love.</hi> For as when we bear any hatred to another,<note place="margin">Self-love.</note> our hatred will make us ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his faults, and to lay them open; ſo ſelf-love will make us to leſſen our own, and to hide and cover them. Thus becauſe the Phariſees hated our Saviour, they never lin mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſpeaking againſt him, backbiting his perſon, depraving his miracles, and carping at his doctrine. But for their own ſins, their eyes were ſo blinded with ſelf-love, that they could not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118276:118"/>ſee them. He that looks upon any thing through a perſpective, if he look one way through it, it makes every thing ſeem to be greater then it is; but turning the perſpective, and looking the other way through it, it makes it ſeem leſſe. So it is with us, while we look through malice and ill-will upon others, and ſelf-love upon our ſelves, it makes other mens ſins ſeem greater then they are, and our own leſſe; but let us turn the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, that their faults and not ours may be leſſened by us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third cauſe which makes a man cover and hide his ſins, is <hi>hipocriſie;</hi> whereby a man deſires to ſeem better then he is,<note place="margin">Hipocriſie.</note> and ſo for the ſaving of his good name and credit will conceal his faults. For ſin hath this property, that it leaves a bad report, and an ill name behinde it; and therefore there is not any man though he delight in ſin, but in regard of the ſhame of it, he had rather conceal it then have it known. Therefore ſins are called <hi>the works of darkneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.11.</note> becauſe he that commits them will avoid the light, that his ſins may be the better conceal'd, and hidden. And therefore the devil,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> who is called the father of ſin and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he transforms himſelf into an angel of light, that ſo he may ſeem to be better then he is. For there is none ſo bad, but he hath a deſire to ſeem good; and hence it is, that hipocrites deſire to ſeem religious, and though they ſerve the devil, yet they will mask in Gods liverie that they may be counted his ſervants, not deſiring ſo much to be ſo indeed, as to ſeem to be ſo in outward appearance. For the health of the bodie, every man had rather to be well, then to ſeem to be ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man have received a wound he will lay it open before the Chirurgion that it may be cured, not caring for a plaiſter that will hide his ſore, but for one that will heal it. But for the health of the ſoul, many had rather to be thought to be well, then to be ſo indeed, taking no thought for their ſins but this, that they may keep them ſecret, and ſo fearing more to be hardly thought of by men if their ſins were known, then to be condemned by God for their covering of them. And thus much for the propertie of an impenitent ſinner, that he covers his ſins: I come now to his condition, that he ſhall not proſper.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:118276:119"/>
            <p>Where firſt we may obſerve, that impenitent ſinners who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſins, are croſt in that which they moſt deſire. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing more then that they may proſper and thrive in the world, and they think they ſhall proſper and thrive the better while they conceal their ſins; which if they were known, would impair their credit and eſtimation. But God croſſes them in that which they moſt deſire,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.21.</note> for they ſhall not proſper. No doubt but <hi>Achan</hi> thought to proſper the better, when he ſtole the two hundred ſhekels of ſilver, the wedge of gold, and the Babyloniſh garment, and hid them in his tent; but it thrived not with him,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.25.</note> for God brought it to light, and <hi>Achan</hi> was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death for it. No doubt but <hi>Gehazi</hi> thought to proſper the better by the bribes he took of <hi>Naaman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 5.23.</note> and would not confeſſe that he had taken them; but it thrived not with him: for though he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id his ſin,<note place="margin">2 King. 5.27.</note> yet he could not hide his leproſie which he got with them. No doubt but <hi>Jezabel</hi> thought to proſper the better, when ſhe cauſed <hi>Naboth</hi> to be ſtoned to death, and got his vineyard, and yet covered her ſin, under pretence that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> had deſerved to be ſtoned, for having blaſphemed God and the King; but it thrived not with her, for God brought it to light, and her to a miſerable end for it. So <hi>Herod</hi> no doubt thought to proſper the better, when hearing that the King of the Jews was born, he intended to murther him, to prevent the danger of loſing his kingdome; and yet to cover his ſin, willed the Wiſemen as ſoon as they had found the babe to bring him word,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.8.</note> pretending that he alſo would go to worſhip him; but it thrived not with him, for God both brought to light his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous intent, and himſelf to ſhame and diſgrace by it. And not to inſtance in too many examples, the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees no doubt thought to proſper the better, while they devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed widows houſes; and to cover their ſin made long prayers, that ſo they might be thought to be devout and religious: but it thrived not with them, for Chriſt both diſcovered what they did,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.14.</note> and denounced a wo againſt them for it. Thus God finds them out, and brings them to light that cover their ſins, not ſuffering them to proſper, and ſo croſſing them in that which they moſt deſire. Yet when or wherein they ſhall not proſper is not here ſet down, but onely in generall that they ſhall not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:118276:119"/>proſper; to the intent that they may never be ſecure, but may ſtill expect while they cover their ſins, that God will puniſh them ſome way or other, either in their own perſons, or in their children, or in their goods, or in their good name, or in them all together.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here we may obſerve, that to proſper is the gift of God, who therefore denyes it to them that ſin againſt him by covering their ſins. Therefore the Pſalmiſt ſaith of the godly man, that <hi>look whatſoever he doth it ſhall proſper:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.3.</note> but for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly he ſaith, <hi>It is not ſo with them.</hi> So it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he was a proſperous man,<note place="margin">Gen. 39.3.</note> and that the Lord made all that he did to proſper in his hand. So it is ſaid of that good King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah, That the Lord was with him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 18.7.</note> 
               <hi>and he proſpered whither ſoever he went forth.</hi> I might inſtance in others.</p>
            <p>But ſome man may ſay, may not the like be ſaid of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? do not they often proſper in the world, and have ſucceſſe in that which they take in hand?<note place="margin">Iob 21.7.9.</note> was it not for this which <hi>Job</hi> complained, that <hi>the wicked are mighty in pomer, that they ſpend their dayes in mirth,</hi> that <hi>their houſes are ſafe from fear,</hi> and <hi>that the rod of God is not upon them?</hi> And was it not for this that <hi>David</hi> envied the wicked, <hi>That they proſper in the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 7 3.12.</note> 
               <hi>that they have riches in poſſeſſion, and that they come in no misfortune like other men?</hi> We muſt therefore underſtand, firſt, that though to proſper be the gift of God, yet in his wiſdome he gives in ſometimes to the godly, and ſometimes to the wicked. For that which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith of wealth, may be ſaid of proſperity, <hi>Ne putetur eſſe mala datur &amp; bonis, &amp; ne putetur eſſe ſummum bonum datur &amp; malis;</hi> Leſt proſperitie ſhould be thought to be evill, it is ſometimes given to thoſe that are good; and leſt it ſhould be thought to be the chief good, it is ſometimes given to thoſe that are bad. If onely the wicked and none of the godly ſhould proſper in the world, it would be a means to draw many to ungodlineſſe, that they might proſper by it. And if onely the godly, and none of the wicked ſhould proſper here, it would be thought they were godly for no other end but that they might proſper. This was that which the devill ye know objected againſt <hi>Job,</hi> for his ſerving God, <hi>Doth Job,</hi> ſaith the devill, <hi>fear God for nought? Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his bouſe,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:118276:120"/>and about all that he hath on every ſide? thou haſt bleſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the works of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the land. But put forth thy hand and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> And thus if God ſhould give proſperitie to none but the godly, the wicked would be readie to object againſt them, that they therefore ſerved God, becauſe God would proſper them, and that otherwiſe they would be as ungodly as others.</p>
            <p>Whereas the godly indeed do as well ſerve God in the time of adverſitie, as they do in proſperitie; as <hi>Job</hi> when all that he had was taken from him, did bleſſe God as well as he did when he had them. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath given, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> And therefore proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is commonly given indifferently by God, ſometimes to the godly, and ſometimes to the wicked. But yet there is great difference between their proſperitie, for the proſperitie of the wicked continues not long, but is ſoon gone; They may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſins, and proſper for a time, but God at one time or other, either here or hereafter, brings their ſins to light, and themfelves to confuſion.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Solomon,</hi> ye ſee, ſpeaks not here of the preſent time, but of the future; he doth not ſay they do not, but that they ſhall not proſper, becauſe though they may proſper for a while in this world, yet at laſt they come to a miſerable end; and miſerable, ye know, is that proſperitie which ends in miſerie.</p>
            <p>Such was the proſperitie of <hi>Haman,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered for a while, but their end was miſerable. But the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the contrarie proſper more and more; though their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning be good, yet, as <hi>Job</hi> was, their end is better. <hi>Marke,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 37 37.</note> Pſalme 37. <hi>the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace:</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>But the end of the wicked ſhall be cut off.</hi> For God being the juſt Judge of the world, it cannot be otherwiſe, but that between the end of the godly, and the end of the wicked, there muſt needs be great difference.</p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:118276:120"/>
            <p>Therefore when <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed for <hi>Sodom,</hi> that it might be ſpared for the righteous ſake that were therein,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.23.25.</note> wilt thou (ſaith he) <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. deſtroy the righteous with the wicked? that be far from thee to do after this manner, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked that be farre from thee, ſhall not the judge of all the earth do right? to ſhew that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with the juſtice of God to reſpect them alike, and to make no difference between the godly and the wicked. We ſee many times that the wicked do flouriſh, and proſper in the world, and live in great credit and eſtimation: the godly on the contrary, are many times vilified, and privily ſlander'd, whereby their good name (which is the godly mans Heire) is much called into queſtion: but God who never failes to help them to right, that do ſuffer wrong, at one time or other brings the wicked to ſhame, and makes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of the godly known.</p>
            <p>This is that which God promiſes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>He ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſſe as the light, and thy judgement (or juſt dealing) as the noon-day:</hi> the meaning is, that though thy innocency and juſt dealing, may be obſcured and hidden for a time, as the light in the night, yet God will bring it forth like the light in the morning, and make it more and more, to appear like the Sun at noone; whereby both thy innocencie, and the falſhood of thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly accuſe thee, ſhall be openly known. This we ſee by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was caſt by his accuſers into the Lyons Den,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.21.</note> and by thoſe who were caſt into the fiery furnace, yet God mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly made known their innocency, and brought thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed them, to ſhame and deſtruction. It is very memorable, which we find recorded to this purpoſe, in the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

               </gap> befallen his Companions, confeſſed how they had wrongfully

Whereupon the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who had been depoſed upon their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was reſtored unto his <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> God having thus made his innocency known, and brought them to ſhame that ſo falſly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. And thus much for the former part of theſe words, the deſcription of an impenitent ſinner, who is deſcribed as you have heard, both by his property, that he covers his ſinne, and by his condition, <hi>that he ſhall not proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The penitent perſon is deſcribed by a double property, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth his ſinnes, and withall, forſakes them, and his condition is, that he ſhall have mercy. I will ſpeak briefly of them in a word or two.</p>
            <p>Thoſe words of St. <hi>John.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9.</note> 
               <hi>If we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> are as it were a commentary upon my Text, and the one place may ſerve well to explain the other. St. <hi>John</hi> names onely our confeſſing our ſinnes. If, ſaith he, we confeſſe our ſinnes, implying under confeſſing our ſinnes, our forſaking of them: becauſe as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Confeſſio peccati eſt profeſſio deſinendi,</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of ſinne, is a profeſſion of leaving the ſame. <hi>Solomon</hi> in my Text doth name them both, who ſo confeſſes and forſakes his ſins, and ſo expreſſes what St. <hi>John</hi> implies. And <hi>Solomon</hi> addes that he ſhall have mercy, but what mercy he doth not ſhew, St. <hi>John</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewes what this mercy is, that God will forgive him his ſinnes, and will cleanſe him from all unrighteouſneſſe: which you know is the greateſt mercy. For if we conſider how highly God is offended, with ſinners, how deeply we are indebted unto God by our ſinnes, or the great benefit we reape by Gods forgiving us, we cannot but ſee Gods infinite mercy, in forgiving our ſinnes upon ſo eaſie a condition, and requiring no more of us for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, but that we confeſſe them. If a Creditor ſhould require no more of his Debtor, that were indebted in a great ſumme unto him, but to acknowledge the debt, &amp; he would freely forgive him; would not every man magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Creditors bounty, in releaſing his Debtor upon ſo eaſie a condition? but thus deales God with us, he requires no more of us but to confeſſe our ſinnes, and promiſes to forgive us. If (ſaith St. <hi>John</hi>) we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſinnes: faithfull and juſt, and ſo we need not make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118276:121"/>doubt thereof, becauſe his faithfulneſſe and juſtice are ingaged upon it. But ſome may ſay, it may ſeeme, that ſeeing God is juſt, he ſhould rather puniſh us, then forgive us our ſinnes, becauſe his juſtice requires that we make him ſatisfaction, and that he reward us according to our deſerts. We are therefore to remember, that confeſſion of our ſinnes and faith in Chriſt for the pardon of them do alway go together: ſo that we cannot truly confeſſe our ſins, but we muſt needes have an eye unto Chriſt, for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes. God therefore cannot but forgive us our ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is juſt, for otherwiſe he ſhould be unjuſt to his Sonne, who hath made ſatisfaction to God in our roome, and by his active and paſſive obedience, hath merited for us that our ſinnes ſhould be forgiven. And herein appeares the admirable wiſdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, in ſo contriving the work of our redemption, that his juſtice ſhould plead for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, which pleaded before for our condemnation. For if ye aske why God ſhould condemn us for our ſinnes: the Reaſon is, becauſe he is juſt, and juſtice requires that having offended him, we ſhould make him ſatisfaction: And yet if ye aske why he ſhould forgive us our ſinnes, the reaſon is here given by St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he is juſt, and juſtice requires, that Chriſt having made ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us, we ſhould be forgiven. And ſo we ſee what mercy it is which he ſhall have, who confeſſeth his ſinnes: namely, the pardon and forgiveneſſe of them.</p>

The day of his firſt coming ye know is paſt, and yet ſo paſt, as that we are ſtill to call it to mind, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget it: the day of his ſecond coming is yet to come, yet ſo to come, as that it will come we know not how ſoone, and we muſt alwayes expect it. And therefore as it hath been a Cuſtome in ſome Countries, that when they kept a feaſt, after other diſhes, a deaths head was brought in, and ſet upon the Table before the gueſts, to teach them while they were feaſting, to remember their ends: So I thought it not unfit at the time of this feaſt, which we celebrate in remembrance of Chriſts firſt coming, to bring in as it were a deaths head among you, by chooſing ſuch a Text as may put you in mind of his ſecond coming at the day of judgement, becauſe that is a day which is alwayes to be expected: whereof the Apoſtle in the words which I have read, gives a double Reaſon.</p>

We ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times that ſuch as are to come before earthly Judges, do break out of priſon, and eſcape the judgement that ſhould paſſe upon them: but there can be no hope for any to eſcape at the day of judgement, for indeed the whole World, is as it were, Gods priſon-houſe, every part whereof on that day, ſhall bring forth their priſoners.<note place="margin">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall be made between them. For then Chriſt ſhall place the ſheep on his right hand, and the goats on his leſt: the wheat and the corn ſhall be carried into his barn, the chaffe and the tares ſhall be caſt into the fire; the godly ſhall be taken up into heaven, the wicked thrown into hell. And in theſe reſpects, it is called <hi>the great and notable day of the Lord,</hi> becauſe ſo great and notable things ſhall come to paſſe on that day. And thus much concerning the day it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, is <hi>the coming of |this day;</hi> and therein two things are ſet down, that it is certain this day will come. <hi>For you your ſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>know perfectly that the day of the Lord comes.</hi> And that it is untertain when it will come, <hi>It comes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as a thiefe in the night, Whoſe coming is uncertain, and not known when he comes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, concerning the certainty of the coming of this day, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of ſome that make but a mock of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the day of judgement.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>Know this</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter) that there ſhall be ſcoffers in the laſt dayes, Walking after their own luſts, &amp; ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming; for ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all things continue</hi> (ſay they) <hi>as they were from the beginning of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi> And thus many becauſe the World hath continued ſo long a time in the ſame ſtate, do perſwade themſelves that it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo for ever, and that there ſhall be no end of the World, nor day of judgement. Theſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes by this reaſon, That though the World have continued in the ſame ſtate for a long time, yet it followes not from thence, that therefore the World ſhould continue ſo for ever: for it wa a long time from the Creation of the world till the coming of the floud, yet the world was then deſtroyed by one of the elemente whereof it was made, namely, by <hi>water:</hi> and ſo though it ſeems a long time till the end of the world, yet in the end it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by another element, namely, by <hi>Fire.</hi> And as they who lived in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> would not be perſwaded that the world ſhould be drowned, till the floud came ſuddenly, and ſwept them away; ſo the end of the world, and Chriſts coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall as ſuddenly come upon unbelievers, while they think not of it. Chriſt indeed, doth deferre his coming in divers reſpects, <hi>As that the number of the elect may be fulfill'd, whom God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed from all etermity to call in all ages by the preaching of the Goſpel,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:118276:125"/>till the end of the world, that the patience of the faithfull, who waite and long for the coming of Chriſt may be tried and exerciſed, and that the wicked may be left without excuſe, being forborne ſo long, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſo large a time of repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe reſpects Chriſt defers his coming, but though his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be deferr'd for a time, yet in the end he will not faile to come, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> aſſures us by evident teſtimonies, by viſible ſignes, and by inviſible reaſons. The teſtimonies are divers, The Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> which is alleadged by Saint <hi>Jude</hi> is plaine and evident,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 14.15.</note> 
               <hi>Enoch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſeventh from Adam propheſied, ſaying, Behold the Lord comes with ten thouſand of his Saints to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all the ungodly among them of all their wicked deads.</hi> Where ye ſee the world was no ſooner made, but that the end thereof was preſently fore-told; for <hi>Enoch</hi> was but the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet he propheſied of Chriſts coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ſo plainly as if he had ſeen him coming, <hi>Ecce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he comes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9.10.</note> So <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied of the day of judgement, <hi>I beheld</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>till the thrones were prepared, and the auncient of dayes did ſit, there iſſued forth a fiery ſtream, and came forth from before him, thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him, the judgement was ſet, and the books were opened. I ſaw</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John) the dead, both ſmall and great ſtand before the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12.</note> 
               <hi>and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which was the book of life, and the dead were judged, &amp;c.</hi> Where to ſhew the certainty of Chriſts coming to judgement, he ſpeaks (ye ſee) thereof as if it were paſt, becauſe he ſhall come at the time appointed, as certainly as if he were come already. I might alleadge many other places, wherein the coming of Chriſt to judgement is plainly fore-told. And as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have fore-told Chriſts coming to judgement; ſo to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us the better thereof, it hath likewiſe given us many ſignes which go before it, whereby we may know that it will not be long before he come. When the King, ye know, is come to a Town, he commonly ſends his harbingers before him, and when they ſee his harbingers, they ſay the King is coming becauſe they know by the coming of his harbingers, that it will not be long before the King himſelfe comes. Chriſt hath given us many ſignes of the end of the world, and his coming to judgement, which are as his harbingers ſent before his coming: and theſe ſignes which go before his coming, are of two ſorts, either ſuch as go longer
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:118276:125"/>before his coming, and are further from it, or ſuch as go but hard before, and ſhall be nigh unto it. Of the former ſort are divers ſignes as the preaching of the Goſpell all over the world, foretold by our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>24.2.</hi> Theſ. <hi>2.</hi> Rom. <hi>11.</hi> Luke <hi>17.</hi>
               </note> 24. <hi>The revealing of Antichriſt that man of ſinne, and ſonne of perdition,</hi> fore-told by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>The calling of the Jews,</hi> fore-told by St. <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>The great ſecurity &amp; want of faith which ſhal be found in many,</hi> foretold by Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. And many other ſignes which the <hi>Scripture</hi> mentions many whereof are already paſt, and are fore-runners of the end of the world, and ſhall continue and prolong their courſe till the very day of Chriſts coming to judgement. Of the ſecond ſort are thoſe fearfull ſignes which the <hi>Scripture</hi> mentions in divers places, as <hi>that the earth ſhall tremble, and move out of her place;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>24.29.</hi> Acts <hi>2.20.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that the ſeas ſhall roare, and make an hidcous noiſe; that the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken, that the ſtarres ſhall fall from heaven, that the Sunne ſhall be turned into darkneſſe and the Moon into bloud, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.</hi> Theſe things ſhall come to paſſe at the end of the world, and when theſe things come to paſſe, they are evident ſigns that the end of the world is then hard at hand. For like as it is in the body of man, when the eyes waxe dimme, and the ſight failes, when all the joynts waxe weake, and the whole body trembles, it is a ſigne of old age, and a manifeſt token that he in whom theſe ſignes are to be ſeen, is very near his end, and cannot hold out long. So it is likewiſe in the great Body of the world, when the eyes of the world, the Sunne and the Moon begin to wax dim, and their light failes; when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall be ſhaken as it were with a palſie, and the earth ſhall tremble, and move out of her place, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks, it is a manifeſt ſigne that the world is ending Laſtly, As the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath foretold the end of the world, &amp; Chriſts coming to judgment, both by evident teſtimonies and viſible ſigns, ſo likewiſe by divers invincible reaſons. For firſt, all other things which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have fore-told, are come to paſſe, as namely, <hi>of Chriſts firſt coming in the fleſh, of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, of the diſperſion of the Iows, of the coming of Antichriſt;</hi> all which, and many other, as they have been fore told, ſo they have been likewiſe accompliſht: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Scripture</hi> having likewiſe fore-ſpoken of the end of the world, and of Chriſts ſecond coming, they ſhall alſo be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in their due time. For Gods will is immutable, and what he hath ſaid muſt needs come to paſſe at the time appointed.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:118276:126"/>
            <p>Secondly, Gods juſtice requires, <hi>that all men ſhould be rewarded according to their works;</hi> and therefore that the wicked ſhould hereafter be puniſht, and the godly comforted: We ſee many times that the wicked do perſecute and oppreſſe the godly, and ſuch as are great do wrong the poor, and defraud them of their right, and yet in this world they eſcape unpuniſht: It remaines therefore, that if God be juſt, their judgement is reſerved till another world, that the wicked howſoever they live here in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, may there be puniſht, and that the godly who live here in affliction and miſerie, may be refreſht, and comforted. <hi>For it is a righteous thing with God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>to recompence tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation to them which trouble you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>and to you which are troubled reſt with us, when the Lord Ieſus ſhall ſhew himſelfe from heaven with his mighty Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If there ſhould not hereafter be a day of judgement, then many ſinnes which have been committed here in ſecret ſhould never come to light, and ſo Gods juſtice in puniſhing offenders could not ſo well be made known and manifeſt; and therefore that hypocrites may be known and diſcovered, and the very thoughts of their hearts, and their moſt ſecret ſinnes, which have been concealed from the eyes of the world, may be laid open, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a day of judgement, that ſo Gods juſtice may the better appear in their condemnation. I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge other reaſons, but I think it needleſſe, ſeeing the coming of this day is ſo certain, that the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>You your ſelves know perfectly that the day of the Lord comes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I will come to the next point, <hi>That though it be certaine that this day Will come, yet when it will come it is uncertaine;</hi> as the Apoſtle here ſhews, by ſaying, <hi>it ſo comes as is thiefe in the night, Whoſe coming is on the ſuddain, and when it is not expected.</hi> Therefore the coming of Chriſt to judgement, is likened by him, ſometime to the coming of the floud that drowned the old world. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.38.</note> 
               <hi>As in the dayes that came before the floud, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, untill the day that Noah entred into the Ark, and knew not untill the floud came, and took them all away; ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> Sometimes his coming is likened to a ſnare. So Chriſt having fore-told us,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Luke</hi> 21. of his coming to judgement, <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:118276:126"/>and ſo that day come upon you unawares: for as a ſnare ſhall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</hi> Snares, ye know, are laid for birds &amp; wilde beaſts, while they do not ſuſpect them, they ſecurely ſeek their food, and follow the prey as they uſe to do, and are ſuddenly taken. So ſhall many be at the day of judgement, while they are following the profits &amp; pleaſures of this world, as they are accuſtomed to do, this day ſhall come as a ſnare upon them, when they think not of it. And ſometimes his coming is reſembled <hi>to the coming of a thiefe in the night.</hi> A ſimilitude which is often uſed in the Goſpell, firſt, by our Saviour, and afterwards borrowed from him by his Apoſtles. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.43.</note> 
               <hi>know this, that if the good-man of the houſe had known in what watch the thiefe would have come, he would have watched, and would nat have ſuffered his houſe to be broken up: watch therefore, for ye know not in what houre your Lord doth come.</hi> So <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>If thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>as a thiefe, and thou ſhalt not know at what houre I will come.</hi> So Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>The day of the Lord comes as a thiefe in the night:</hi> and ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>The day of the Lord comes as a thiefe in the night.</hi> To ſhew that it will come at unawares, and when it is not expected. A thiefe, ye know, will not come openly to a houſe in the day when men may ſee him, but he will come in the night when candles are out, and men are aſleep, and think not of him. So will the day of the Lord come, it will not come on the ſudden before men be aware, and take them unprovided, when it comes upon them. If then the coming of this day be unknown, this argues their folly, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſet down the particular time when this day will come; though our Saviour ſaith plainly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36.</note> 
               <hi>That of that day and houre knowes no man, no nor the Angels of Heaven, but his Father onely.</hi> For other matters God hath revealed in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> the definitive time when they ſhould come to paſſe. So for the old World to repent before the coming of the floud,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25.</note> he ſet down an hundred and twenty years. So for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be afflicted in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> four hundred years. For the captivity in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> he ſet down ſeventy years. And for Chriſt firſt coming, <hi>ſeventy weeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for his ſecond coming, he hath not any where ſet down the time but concealed it from us: and therefore for any man to enquire thereinto, as many have done, is but vaine curioſity;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:118276:127"/>becauſe it is not for us to know the times, <hi>and the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> For God hath concealed this day from us, that we might continually expect this day, leaſt it come upon us at unawares. Therefore our Saviour whenſoever he makes mention of his coming to judgement, he wills us to watch, that we may be prepared and ready at the time whenſoever he comes. And indeed great reaſon. If we have a cauſe to be tryed before an earthly Judge, eſpecially if it be in a matter of any great moment, as ſuch as concernes our Land and inheritance, ye know what great paines we will take before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that we may be provided againſt our cauſe be handled, we will ſearch out our records, we will read over our evidences. We will make ready our Witneſſe, and not willingly omit any courſe we can take, that ſentence may be pronounced on our ſide, we have every one of us a cauſe to be tried at the day of judgement, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the weightieſt cauſe that ever was handled, not concerning our Lands or inheritance, but concerning a matter of farre greater importance, even the everlaſting ſalvation or damnation of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules, and therefore it behoves us continually to watch, and to be alwayes in a readineſſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.3.</note> that we be not found unprepared, like the gueſt in the Goſpel, without our wedding Garments, or like the fooliſh virgins without oile in our Lamps. To this end we muſt often think of the day of judgement, and remember that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we do, we ſhall be called to an account of it. Therefore the Scripture doth often propound the day of judgement unto us, and uſeth the ſame as a ſpecial Reaſon, to reclaime us from ſinne, and to move us to repentance.</p>
            <p>This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Atheniant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>That God admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes all men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> tells the young man,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. <hi>11.9.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. <hi>That though he rejoyceth in his youth, and followes the luſt of his eyes, and the wayes of his heart; yet he muſt remember withall, that God for all theſe things will bring him to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Therefore <hi>Baſil</hi> gives us this Councel, to have alwayes the day of judgement as a Schoolmaſter before us, that ſo we might be kept from committing evil, by having this day before our eyes, as a ſcholler is afraid to do any thing undecent in his Maſters preſence. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> makes mention of a certain King, who having the day of judgement alwayes in his mind, he was ſo affected with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it, that he wholly abſtain'd from thoſe pleaſures
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:118276:127"/>&amp; delights, whereunto he had been before addicted. The <hi>Kings</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeing the <hi>King</hi> to be ſo ſtrangely altered, &amp; knowing withal, the cauſe thereof, willed him not to think of the day of judgement, but to paſſe his time in pleaſure and recreation, as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he thought not of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> to argue his Brothers folly, cauſed his Herald the very next morning to ſound a <hi>Trumpet</hi> a loud at his Brothers doore, which was a ſigne in that Countrey, that, he at whoſe door the <hi>Trumpet</hi> was ſounded, had offended the <hi>King,</hi> and was therefore to be led to execution.</p>
            <p>His Brother as ſoone as he heard the <hi>Trumpet,</hi> came trembling to the <hi>King,</hi> and deſired pardon, and promiſed that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offend him again. Why ſaith the <hi>King,</hi> art thou ſo afraid when thou heareſt this <hi>Trumpet,</hi> and ſhould not I be afraid of that great <hi>Trumpet</hi> that ſhall call me to judgement? if thou be afraid, becauſe of this <hi>Trumpet,</hi> of offending me; much more may I by the laſt <hi>Trumpet</hi> of offending God. And indeed the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinner that is, if the day of judgement were alwayes in his minde, ſo that he were wholly poſſeſt with the remembrance of it, it would make him afraid to commit ſinne, and ſo haſten his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, becauſe he may die and be called to judgement, he knows not how ſoone, and if he be impenitent when he dies, he will be found impenitent at the day of judgement. <hi>Hic hic amittitur vita aut recuperatur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> In this life the life to come is either loſt or gotten, loſt by continuing impenitent in our ſinnes, or got by repentance. God made this Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. That if a man had had a houſe in a walled City, and had ſold the ſame,<note place="margin">Levit. <hi>25.29.</hi>
               </note> yet he might redeeme it within the compaſſe of a year; but if he redeemed it not within that time, it ſhould afterwards be too late to recover it again, which <hi>Origen</hi> expounding, he ſaith, that by this houſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood our heavenly Habitation; that houſe whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes: We have a houſe not made with hands,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</note> but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the Heavens: by him that ſells this houſe is underſtood a ſinner, who ſells as it were and forgoes Heaven by his ſinnes, yet ſuch (ſaith he) is the mercy of this Law-giver, that he hath given a ſinner the whole year of this life for the recovery thereof, that what he ſold by his ſinnes, he might redeeme by repentance; which if he redeemed not before the year of this life be ended, it will be too late afterwards. He that repents not till this life be paſt, he knocks with the fooliſh Virgins, when the Gates are ſhut,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.11.12.</note> and then
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118276:128"/>he cannot be let in,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24.</note> he that ſeekes not for mercy till after this life, like the rich man, he ſhall finde none, no not ſo much as a drop of cold water to coole his tongue. And therefore now while it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to day, think thus with thy ſelf, God hath ſpared me hitherto, and not taken me away, that I might repent, how long he wil ſpare me I do not know, he may take me away before to morrow, &amp; if he take me away before I repent. Chriſt will condemn me for my impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie when he comes to judgement: I will therefore now make a vow unto God, even now before I goe out of his houſe, that I will not ſuffer mine eyes to ſleep, nor the Temples of my head to take any reſt, till I turne unto God by unfained repentance, and reſolve with my ſelf to lead a new life, that ſo I may be ſure not to be found impenitent whenſoever he comes.</p>
